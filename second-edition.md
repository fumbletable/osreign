- Feats for building your archetype
- Equipment and encumbrance
- Core rules: combat, rests, exploration
- Magic and spells
- Advancement and economy

### Refereeing

Everything the Referee needs to run the game:
- Referee principles and advice

- NPCs, reactions, and morale
- Bestiary (190+ monsters)
- Treasure tables
- GM tools and generators
