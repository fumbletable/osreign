### How to Play

Learn the core mechanics first: checks, saves, DCs, **Edge** and **Setback**, Boost Dice.

### Character

Build your character from the ground up—abilities, ancestry, background, class, feats—and see where they're heading with advancement.

### Equipment

Weapons, armor, adventuring gear, and how much you can carry.

### Magic

For casters: spell slots, preparation, ritual magic, and complete spell lists by tier.

### Adventuring

What happens in the field: time and movement, rests and fatigue, combat, exploration.

### Downtime

What happens between adventures: hiring help and carousing.
