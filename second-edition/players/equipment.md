# Equipment

Here's what you can buy and how much you can carry.

---

## Coins & Wealth

The adventuring economy runs on gold.

- **100 cp = 10 sp = 1 gp**
- You'll use copper for small purchases, silver for everyday goods, and gold for anything serious.

When you sell treasure:
- **Arms & Armor:** You get half value.
- **Gems & Art Objects:** Full value.
- **Magic Items:** Rare - you'll need to negotiate in a major settlement.

## Encumbrance (reminder)

You can carry 10 + STR slots. A backpack adds another 10. Bulky items take 2 slots.

If you're over capacity, your Speed drops to Slow and you make a CON save (DC 12) or gain 1 Fatigue.
