# Combat

Here's how fights work.

---

## Combat Order

1. **First contact:** Each hero rolls d20 + DEX vs DC 12. Pass = you go first.
2. **Heroes who passed** declare actions, roll, and resolve.
3. **All enemies** declare and resolve.
4. **All heroes** declare and resolve.
5. Repeat steps 3–4 until combat ends.

**On your turn:** Move up to your Speed and take one Action.

**Why declare first?** Everyone on a side says what they're doing before any dice are rolled. This means actions happen simultaneously — no waiting to see if an ally kills a target before you commit. It keeps combat fast and rewards coordination.

---

## Attacks & Damage

To hit, roll d20 + ability + PB. Beat the target's AC and you hit. Use STR for melee, DEX for ranged (or Finesse weapons).

**Hit:** Roll your weapon damage + ability. Subtract from their HP.

**Crit:** Natural 20 doubles your damage dice.

**Miss:** No damage. The Referee might add a minor complication.

**Cover:** Partial cover gives SETBACK to the attacker or +2 AC—Referee's call.

---

## Saving Throws

Roll d20 + ability (+ PB if you've got it) vs the DC. Beat it and you avoid or reduce the harm. Fail and you take the full effect. Don't forget to apply your Fatigue penalty.

---

## Death & Dying

At 0 HP, you're dying. Each round, roll 2d6 minus your Fatigue.

| Roll | What happens |
|------|--------------|
| 11+ | You're back up with HP equal to CON or one Hit Die roll (minimum 1) |
| 10 | Stable—you wake next turn at 1 HP |
| 5–9 | Still dying—roll again next round |
| 4 | Dead, but you get one heroic action before you fall |
| 3– | Dead outright |

---

## Combat Actions

On your turn you can move up to your Speed and take one Action.

| Action | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Attack** | Melee or ranged attack vs AC |
| **Cast Spell** | Resolve per the spell description |
| **Dodge** | Attacks against you have SETBACK until your next turn |
| **Disengage** | Move without provoking opportunity attacks |
| **Dash** | Double your movement this turn |
| **Help** | Give an ally EDGE on their next roll (must be in reach) |
| **Grapple** | STR vs their STR or DEX—success means their Speed drops to 0 |
| **Shove** | STR vs their STR or DEX—push them 5 ft or knock them prone |
| **Disarm** | STR or DEX vs theirs—they drop their weapon |
| **Hide** | DEX check, needs cover or distraction |
| **Stabilize** | Costs 1 Supply—dying ally becomes stable, wakes at 1 HP next turn |
| **Use Object** | Draw, drink, light, open, or interact once |
| **Ready** | Name a trigger—when it happens, take your prepared action as a Reaction |
| **Improvise** | Describe something creative, roll vs DC, see what happens |

**Opportunity Attack:** When a foe leaves your reach without Disengaging, you can use your Reaction to attack them. Once per round.

Combat ends when all foes flee, surrender, or fall.
