# Combat

## Combat Order
1. **Reflex check:**
   • Everyone rolls `d20 + DEX mod` vs DC 12 (Easy 8 / Hard 16 at Referee's call).
   • Pass → act before the enemy this round.
   • Fail → miss your first turn; join in next round.
2. **After round 1:** Heroes act first each round, then the enemy.
3. **On your turn:** Move up to your Speed + take 1 Action.
4. **Ongoing effects:** Count down on your turn.

---

## Attacks & Damage
- **Attack roll:** `d20 + ability mod + PB` ≥ target AC.
  - STR for melee, DEX for ranged or Finesse.
- **Hit:** Roll weapon/spell damage + ability mod; subtract from target HP.
- **Crit:** Natural 20 = double damage dice.
- **Miss:** No damage (Referee may add a minor complication).
- **Cover or concealment:** May grant SETBACK or +2 AC (Referee call).

---

## Saving Throws
- Roll `d20 + relevant ability mod (+PB if proficient)` vs DC set by the Referee.
- Success = avoid or reduce harm; failure = full effect.

---

## Death & Dying
- At **0 HP**, roll **2d6 – Fatigue** each round until you recover or die.

| Roll | Result |
|------|---------|
| 11+ | Pop up with HP = CON mod or HD roll (min 1). |
| 10 | Stable; wake next turn at 1 HP. |
| 4 | Dead, but take one **heroic action** before you fall. |
| 3– | Dead outright. |
| 5–9 | Still dying; roll again next round. |
