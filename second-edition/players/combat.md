# Combat

Here's how fights work.

---

## Combat Order

1. **First contact:** Each hero rolls d20 + DEX vs DC 12. Pass = you go first.
2. **Heroes who passed** declare actions, roll, and resolve.
3. **All enemies** declare and resolve.
4. **All heroes** declare and resolve.
5. Repeat steps 3–4 until combat ends.

**On your turn:** Move up to your Speed and take one Action.

**Why declare first?** Everyone on a side says what they're doing before any dice are rolled. This means actions happen simultaneously — no waiting to see if an ally kills a target before you commit. It keeps combat fast and rewards coordination.

## Attacks & Damage

Roll d20 + ability + PB. Meet or beat the target's AC and you hit.

- **Melee:** Add STR to attack and damage rolls.
- **Ranged:** Add DEX to attack rolls only (no damage bonus).
- **Finesse weapons:** Use DEX for both attack and damage instead of STR.

**Hit:** Roll your weapon's damage dice + ability (for melee/finesse). Subtract from their HP.

**Critical Hit:** Natural 20 doubles your damage dice (not your ability).

**Miss:** No damage.

**Fumble:** Natural 1 invites a complication—dropped weapon, slipped footing, friendly fire. Referee's call.

**Cover:**
- *Partial cover* (half-hidden): Attacker has SETBACK.
- *Full cover* (completely obscured): Can't be targeted.

## Saving Throws

Roll d20 + ability vs the DC. Meet or beat it and you avoid or reduce the harm. Fail and you take the full effect.

You add PB to saves your class grants proficiency in. Don't forget to apply your Fatigue penalty.

---

## Death & Dying

At 0 HP, you're dying. Each round, roll 2d6 minus your Fatigue.

| Roll | What happens |
|------|--------------|
| 11+ | You're back up with HP equal to CON or one Hit Die roll (minimum 1) |
| 10 | Stable—you wake next turn at 1 HP |
| 5–9 | Still dying—roll again next round |
| 4 | Dead, but you get one heroic action before you fall |
| 3– | Dead outright |

**Getting back up:** When you recover from 0 HP, make a CON save (DC 12) or gain 1 [Fatigue](rests-recovery-fatigue). Getting knocked out takes a toll.

## Combat Actions

On your turn you can move up to your Speed and take one Action.

| Action | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Attack** | Melee or ranged attack vs AC |
| **Cast Spell** | Resolve per the spell description |
| **Dodge** | Attacks against you have SETBACK until your next turn |
| **Disengage** | Move without provoking opportunity attacks. You can Dash afterwards to flee |
| **Dash** | Double your movement this turn |
| **Help** | Give an ally EDGE on their next roll (must be in reach) |
| **Grapple** | STR vs their STR or DEX—success means their Speed drops to 0 |
| **Shove** | STR vs their STR or DEX—push them 5 ft or knock them prone |
| **Disarm** | STR or DEX vs theirs—weapon flies d10 ft in a random direction |
| **Hide** | DEX check, needs cover or distraction |
| **Stabilize** | Costs 1 Supply—dying ally becomes stable, wakes at 1 HP next turn |
| **Ready** | Name a trigger—when it happens, take your prepared action |
| **Improvise** | Describe something creative, roll vs DC, see what happens |

**Free actions:** You can do minor things alongside your move and action—draw a weapon, open a door, shout a warning, drink a potion.

## Opportunity Attacks

When a foe leaves your reach, you can make one free attack against them. This doesn't use up your turn.

**You can't make an opportunity attack if:**
- The foe Disengaged before moving
- You're already in melee with another creature

You can only make one opportunity attack per round.

---

Combat ends when all foes flee, surrender, or fall.
