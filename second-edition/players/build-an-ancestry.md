# Build-an-Ancestry

OSwR uses four core ancestries - Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, and Human - but you can easily create new ones.

Each ancestry has **3 traits max** (Humans are the exception). Traits come in a few categories:

- **Sense:** Darkvision (30 ft) or EDGE on a sense (sight, hearing, smell). Keep darkvision rare.
- **Resist:** EDGE on one type of save (poison, charm, fear, spells, cold/heat).
- **Knack:** EDGE on one exploration task (stone sense, find secret doors, woodland stealth, tracking).
- **Quirk:** A small, always-on perk (ignore Winded once/day, treat Bulky as 1 slot, EDGE on sling attacks).

Pick 2–3 that fit the concept. Don't stack the same category twice.

Each core ancestry also has **one Essential trait** - a non-negotiable ability that defines them in old-school play.

## Mystara Examples

These examples use the Build-an-Ancestry rules to show how you might create other ancestries in a Mystara-inspired setting.

---

### Shadow Elf
**Size:** Medium · **Languages:** Common, Elvish
**Age:** Adult ~100 · Lifespan ~400–1000+

- **Ghoul Immunity (Essential).**
- **Darkvision (30 ft).**
- **Resist Spells:** EDGE on saves vs spells and magical effects.

*Note:* In Mystara, Shadow Elves are mistrusted by surface folk. The Referee may apply SETBACK on reaction rolls with NPCs unfamiliar with their culture.

---

### Gnome
**Size:** Small · **Languages:** Common, Gnomish (often Dwarvish too)
**Age:** Adult ~40 · Lifespan ~300–500

- **Stone Sense (Essential):** As Dwarves, you detect stonework anomalies. If you pass within 5 ft of slopes, seams, traps, or recent masonry, the Referee may roll a secret INT check. When actively searching stonework, roll with EDGE.
- **Resist Illusion:** EDGE on saves vs illusions and trickery.
- **Tinker's Knack:** EDGE on checks to repair, disassemble, or jury-rig mechanical devices.

*Restriction:* You're Small, so you can't wield Large or Heavy weapons (polearms, greatswords, etc.).
