# Magic-User

Magic-Users wield arcane power through study and intellect. You're fragile in combat but devastating when your spells hit—and the higher you level, the more reality bends to your will.

**HD:** 4 + CON, then 1d4 (avg 2) + CON per level
**Saves:** INT, WIS
**Ability Boost:** +1 INT
**Weapons:** Light
**Armor:** None

---

## Spellcasting

- **Casting stat:** INT
- **Save DC:** 8 + PB + INT
- **Spell attack:** PB + INT
- **Preparation:** After a rest, prepare spells equal to your **level + INT**.
- **Casting:** Spend a slot of the spell's tier or higher. The slot is lost; the spell remains on your list.
- **Progression:** Magic-Users use the Spell Slot Progression table (see [Magic Overview](magic.md)).

---

## Cantrips

At level 1 you know two cantrips:

- **Wizard Bolt:** Make a **ranged spell attack** against one target within **NEAR**.
  - On a hit: deal `1d3` force damage.
  - This is treated as a magical attack.
- **Prestidigitation:** Create harmless sensory effects or minor magical tricks (e.g., spark, puff of wind, change in taste). The Referee decides limits.

## Boost Hook

When casting a spell marked **Boostable**, you may spend a **Boost Die** to trigger its extra effect (e.g., *Magic Missile* adds an extra dart).

---

## Spellbook

You begin with a spellbook containing *Read Magic* plus **(1 + INT)** 1st-tier spells.
- Add spells by copying from scrolls, other spellbooks, or through research.
- Without your spellbook, you cannot prepare new spells.

See [Spellbooks & Research](spellbooks-and-research.md) for copying, research, and scroll rules.
