# Hiring Help

Dungeons are deadly. Smart adventurers bring backup.

---

## Why Hire?

- **Carry loot** — more hands means more treasure
- **Hold torches** — someone needs to light the way
- **Watch the rear** — ambushes happen
- **Fight alongside you** — extra swords matter when HP is low
- **Replace the fallen** — if your character dies, a loyal retainer might step up

---

## Who Can You Hire?

**Retainers** are the most common hirelings:
- Commoners, mercenaries, would-be adventurers
- Found in taverns, guilds, or through notices
- Expect payment (2–5 gp/day) plus a share of treasure

**Specialists** handle specific jobs:
- Torchbearers (cheap, fragile)
- Porters (carry gear, won't fight)
- Men-at-arms (trained fighters, cost more)
- Guides (know the terrain)

---

## How Many?

Your **Charisma** determines how many retainers will follow you:

**Maximum retainers = PB + CHA** (minimum 0)

High Charisma means more followers and better loyalty. Low Charisma means they're harder to keep.

---

## What Do They Expect?

- **Fair pay** — daily wages, paid on time
- **Fair share** — lower-level retainers want half a share; equals want a full share
- **Fair treatment** — don't use them as trap-finders or meat shields
- **Survival** — they'll leave if you get too many of them killed

Treat them well and they'll stay. Mistreat them and they'll desert — or worse.

---

## Loyalty & Morale

Retainers are not heroes. They have their own survival instincts.

**Loyalty** is how much they trust you. It starts neutral and changes based on how you treat them:

- **Builds loyalty:** Fair pay, bonus treasure, saving their life, giving them good gear
- **Damages loyalty:** Stingy pay, needless risk, using them as trap-finders, getting their friends killed

**Morale** is whether they hold in combat. When the fight turns ugly—allies falling, overwhelming odds—the Referee checks their morale. Loyal retainers hold longer. Mistreated ones break and run.

**The takeaway:** Treat them like valuable allies, not expendable resources, and they'll follow you into the dark. Treat them like meat shields, and they'll abandon you when you need them most.
