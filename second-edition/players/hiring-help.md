# Hiring Help

Dungeons are deadly. Smart adventurers bring backup.

---

## Why Hire?

- **Carry loot** — more hands means more treasure
- **Hold torches** — someone needs to light the way
- **Watch the rear** — ambushes happen
- **Fight alongside you** — extra swords matter when HP is low
- **Replace the fallen** — if your character dies, a loyal retainer might step up

---

## Who Can You Hire?

**Retainers** are the most common hirelings:
- Commoners, mercenaries, would-be adventurers
- Found in taverns, guilds, or through notices
- Expect payment (2–5 gp/day) plus a share of treasure

**Specialists** handle specific jobs:
- Torchbearers (cheap, fragile)
- Porters (carry gear, won't fight)
- Men-at-arms (trained fighters, cost more)
- Guides (know the terrain)

---

## How Many?

Your **Charisma** determines how many retainers will follow you:

**Maximum retainers = PB + CHA** (minimum 0)

High Charisma means more followers and better loyalty. Low Charisma means they're harder to keep.

---

## What Do They Expect?

- **Fair pay** — daily wages, paid on time
- **Fair share** — lower-level retainers want half a share; equals want a full share
- **Fair treatment** — don't use them as trap-finders or meat shields
- **Survival** — they'll leave if you get too many of them killed

Treat them well and they'll stay. Mistreat them and they'll desert — or worse.

---

## In Dangerous Situations

Retainers are not heroes. When the fight turns ugly:
- They might flee
- They might surrender
- They might refuse orders

The Referee tracks their loyalty and morale. Your actions affect both.

## The Bottom Line

You can't always do everything alone. Hiring help is smart, not weak. But remember: these are people with their own survival instincts. Lead well, pay fairly, and they'll follow you into the dark.

For full hiring rules, see the Referee section on [Retainers](../refereeing/retainers.md).
