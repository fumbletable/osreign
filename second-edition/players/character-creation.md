# Character Creation

Here's what you'll do:

1. **Roll Abilities** - Determine your STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA
2. **Choose an Ancestry** - Pick a people with unique traits
3. **Choose a Class** - Decide your role in the party
4. **Pick Feats** - Customise with special abilities
5. **Choose a Background** - Define your history
6. **Choose Languages** - Reflect your knowledge of the world
7. **Buy Equipment** - Weapons, armor, and gear

## Step 1: Roll Abilities

Pick your method:

- **Standard:** Roll 3d6 six times, assign freely.
- **Down the Line:** Roll 3d6 in order (STR → CHA). No swapping. You get **+1 Feat** for putting your fate in the dice gods' hands.

Look up each roll on the table below - that's your ability. Record only the ability on your sheet; the 3d6 total won't be used again. Your class may grant +1 to a specific ability.

### Ability Table

| 3d6 Roll | Ability |
|----------|---------|
| 3        | −4      |
| 4–5      | −3      |
| 6–7      | −2      |
| 8–9      | −1      |
| 10–11    | 0       |
| 12–13    | +1      |
| 14–15    | +2      |
| 16–17    | +3      |
| 18       | +4      |

### The Six Abilities

**Strength (STR)**
Physical power, athletics, brute force. You add STR to melee attack and damage rolls. Your carrying capacity is 10 + STR slots (see [Encumbrance](encumbrance)).

**Dexterity (DEX)**
Agility, reflexes, balance. You add DEX to ranged attack rolls (not damage). With a finesse weapon like a dagger or shortsword, you can use DEX for both attack and damage instead of STR. DEX also adds to your AC (Armor Class—how hard you are to hit).

**Constitution (CON)**
Health, stamina, resilience. You add CON to your HP each level.

**Intelligence (INT)**
Memory, reasoning, knowledge. Magic-Users use INT for spell save DCs and spell attacks. You speak Common plus your ancestry's tongue, and gain bonus languages equal to your INT (minimum 0). If your INT is negative, you're illiterate until you gain literacy through a feat, class feature, or tutor.

**Wisdom (WIS)**
Perception, insight, intuition. Clerics use WIS for spell save DCs and spell attacks.

**Charisma (CHA)**
Personality, charm, leadership. CHA affects reaction rolls (how NPCs respond to you), how many [retainers](hiring-help) you can employ, and social checks like persuasion or intimidation.

### Proficiency Bonus (PB)

Your Proficiency Bonus represents your training. It's +2 at levels 1–4, +3 at levels 5–8, and +4 at levels 9–12.

Add your PB to:
- Attacks with weapons you're proficient in
- Saves you're proficient in
- Checks tied to your class, background, or feats

You only add PB once per roll.

### Using Abilities

When the outcome's uncertain, the Referee calls for an ability check. Roll d20 + ability (+ PB if it applies). Beat the DC and you succeed. Fall short and something goes wrong.

Once you've got your abilities, move on to **Step 2: Choose an Ancestry**.
