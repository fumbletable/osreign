# Character Creation

Here's an overview of the character creation steps:

3. **Choose a Class:** Decide your role in the party.
4. **Pick Feats:** Customize further with special abilities.

6. **Choose Additional Languages:** Reflect your knowledge of the world.
7. **Buy Equipment:** Weapons, armor, and adventuring gear.

## Step 1: Roll Ability Scores

**Choose your method:**
- **Standard:** Roll 3d6 six times, assign freely.
- **Down the Line:** Roll 3d6 in order (STR → CHA).
  - No swapping.
  - Gain **+1 Feat** for putting your fate in the dice gods' hands.

**Record only the modifiers** on your sheet. Erase the totals — they won't be used again.
Classes may grant an extra +1 to a specific ability.

### The Six Abilities

**Strength (STR)**
- Physical power, athletics, brute force.
- Add STR to melee attack and damage.
- **Encumbrance:** Carry `10 + STR` slots of gear.

**Dexterity (DEX)**
- Agility, reflexes, balance.
- Add DEX to **attack rolls** with ranged weapons (not damage).
- With a *finesse* melee weapon (dagger, shortsword, etc.), use **STR or DEX** for attack and damage — your choice.
- **Armor Class (AC):** Add DEX to AC.

**Constitution (CON)**
- Health, stamina, resilience.
- **Hit Points:** Add CON to HP each level.

**Intelligence (INT)**
- Memory, reasoning, knowledge.
- **Magic-Users:** INT sets spell save DC and spell attack bonus.
- **Languages:** You speak Common and your racial tongue.
  - Bonus languages = INT modifier (minimum 0).
  - If your INT modifier is negative, you are **illiterate** (cannot read or write) unless you later gain literacy from a feat, class feature, or tutor.


**Wisdom (WIS)**
- Perception, insight, intuition.
- **Clerics:** WIS sets spell save DC and spell attack bonus.

**Charisma (CHA)**
- Personality, charm, leadership.
- **Reaction Rolls:** CHA shapes NPC first impressions (see [Reaction Rolls](../../refereeing/reaction-rolls/)).
- **Retainers:** CHA sets how many you can employ and affects Loyalty/Morale (see [Retainers](../../refereeing/retainers/)).
- **Social Influence:** Add CHA to checks for persuasion, intimidation, or similar uncertain actions.

### Proficiency Bonus (PB)

Your **Proficiency Bonus (PB)** represents your training and growth.
- At **level 1**, PB = +2.
- PB increases as you level (see [Advancement](../advancement/)).
- Add PB to:
  - Attacks with proficient weapons.
  - Saves you are proficient in.
  - Checks clearly tied to your class, background, or feats.

You only apply PB **once per roll**.

### Using Ability Modifiers

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Referee may call for an **ability check**.

- Roll `d20 + ability mod (+ PB if proficient)`.
- Compare against DC (Normal = 12).
- Success → task accomplished.
- Failure → a consequence or complication follows.

After assigning your modifiers, move to **Step 2: Choose a Race**.
