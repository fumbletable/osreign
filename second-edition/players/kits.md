# Kits

Kits are **specialist toolsets**. Unlike **Provisions** (which cover food, rest, bandages, and other basics), Kits let you attempt actions that are otherwise impossible.

- A Kit does **not** grant EDGE by itself.
- Instead, a Kit allows you to *try* certain actions; without it, you simply cannot attempt them.
- If a roll is required, the Referee sets the DC as usual.

### Common Kits
- **Thieves' Tools:** Pick locks, disable traps, and other mechanical tampering.
- **Disguise Kit:** Create disguises, alter appearance, forge props.
- **Herbalist's Kit:** Brew poultices, identify plants, prepare antidotes.
- **Holy Symbol:** Required for certain Cleric actions (e.g. Turn Undead, some spells).
- **Arcane Focus:** Required for some Magic-User spells and rituals.

### Carrying & Use
- A Kit normally takes **1 slot** of Encumbrance (unless tagged *Bulky*).
- Most Kits have **no daily uses**; their limit is the fiction and time available.
- The Referee may allow a Kit to provide **EDGE** if the player describes especially good use, or when conditions make the task easier.
