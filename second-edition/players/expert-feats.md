# Expert Feats (Draft Review)

These feats are tagged **Expert**. Many overlap with General stealth/social feats or Fighter tricks.

---

## Core Expert (stay Expert)

- Backstab — From hidden: EDGE, +LVL×2 dmg once/target/combat. *(classic thief skill)*
- ~~Charmer~~ — CUT (replaced by Winning Smile)
- Contacts (High) — Noble/merchant connections.
- Contacts (Low) — Underworld connections.
- ~~Crowdworker~~ — CUT (folded into Hide in Shadows / handled narratively)
- Disguise — EDGE to pass as role.
- ~~Fast Talker~~ — CUT (replaced by Winning Smile)
- Forgery Master — EDGE to forge/spot documents.
- Garrote — From behind: restrain & silence target (escape on STR 12).
- ~~Hear Noise~~ — CUT (use General Keen Senses, pick hearing)
- Hide in Shadows — EDGE to hide after LoS break. *(classic thief skill)*
- Infiltrator — EDGE on stealth/deception vs guards.
- Innate Tracker — EDGE to track (numbers, size, time). *(ranger-flavor)*
- ~~Keen Eye~~ — CUT (use Keen Senses or Trap Sense)
- Master of Disguise — Allies gain EDGE from your disguises.
- Pick Locks — Open mundane locks with tools. *(classic thief skill)*
- Pick Pockets — Attempt theft unnoticed (WIS vs your DEX roll).
- Poisoner — Craft/apply poisons; immunity to self-use.
- ~~Shadowstep~~ — CUT (folded into Hide in Shadows)

## Multi-Class (Expert + Fighter)

- Deflect Missiles — +3 AC vs ranged. *(appears in Fighter list too)*
- Gambit — Take SETBACK now; next roll this turn gains +2 EDGE dice. *(feels martial trick too)*

---

## General-leaning (could be broadened)

- Escape Artist — Auto-escape non-magical bonds in 1 Turn. *(already in General)*
- Innate Tracker — Could be shared with Fighter (ranger builds).
- ~~Keen Eye~~ — CUT (replaced by General Keen Senses)
- Streetwise — Could overlap General "Jack of All Trades."

---

## Overlaps / Redundancies

- ~~Assassinate vs Backstab vs Ambush Hunter~~ → **RESOLVED: Backstab (Expert-only), Ambush Hunter (Fighter-only), Assassinate cut**
- Disguise vs Master of Disguise → could fold into one scalable feat.
- ~~Trap Sense + Trap Master~~ → **RESOLVED: Combined into Trap Expert (EDGE to find, disable, or set traps)**
- ~~Hear Noise vs Keen Eye vs Dungeon Cunning~~ → **RESOLVED: All cut, use General Keen Senses (pick sense)**

---

## Notes

- This list maps almost directly to **classic thief abilities** (Hear Noise, Pick Locks, Hide, Backstab, etc.), which is good — Experts feel like the OSR skill chassis.
- Many feats here already overlap with the **General** list (Escape Artist, stealth, social). We need to trim duplicates and decide whether "stealth" lives in Expert only, or is also available as General for other builds.
- ~~Social feats (Charmer, Fast Talker, Streetwise)~~ → **RESOLVED: Consolidated to Silver Tongue (deception) + Winning Smile (persuasion/charm)**
