## Fatigue

### Gaining Fatigue
Whenever you are pushed beyond your limits, roll a **CON save** (Normal DC 12; Hard DC 16 if the source is extreme).
On a failure: gain **+1 Fatigue**.

Common triggers:
- Forced march (extra Watch)
- Slept in Heavy armour
- No Provisions
- Soaked & cold exposure
- Blazing heat
- Long swims/climbs in armour
- Toxic fumes

Other sources:
- Certain monsters, conditions, traps, or spells may directly cause Fatigue.
- The Referee may call for Fatigue saves when the fiction demands it.

*Referee dial:* grant **EDGE** if the party had shelter, gear, or a plan. Apply **SETBACK** if conditions are especially severe.
