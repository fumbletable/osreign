# Magic

Magic in OSwR uses **spell slots**. Each time you cast a spell, you expend one slot of that spell's tier or higher. Slots refresh after a **Night's Rest** or at a **Safe Haven**.

---

## Casting Basics
- **Caster stat:** Cleric/Druid → WIS · Magic-User → INT
- **Save DC:** `8 + PB + caster stat modifier`
- **Focus:** Cleric → holy symbol · Magic-User → arcane focus · Druid → natural focus (mistletoe, staff, etc.)

## Preparing Spells

**Clerics & Druids** pray for their spells. They have access to all spells on their class list and choose which to prepare each day.

**Magic-Users** study their spellbook. They can only prepare spells they have recorded in their book.

- After a **Night's Rest** or at a **Safe Haven**, prepare spells equal to `level + caster stat modifier`.
- Prepared spells form your *daily list*; you may cast any from that list while slots remain.
- You don't need to prepare duplicates — one prep allows multiple casts.
- Changing your list requires another rest.
- **Prep time:** `1 Turn (10 min) × highest spell tier prepared.`
  - Tier 1 → 10 min · Tier 2 → 20 min · Tier 3 → 30 min · Tier 4 → 40 min · Tier 5 → 50 min · Tier 6 → 60 min

## Casting
- **Spend a slot** of that spell's tier or higher; the slot is lost, the spell remains prepared.
- **Boostable:** You may spend a **Boost Die** to heighten a spell's effect (extra missile, extra healing, stronger duration, etc.).
- **Components:** All spells require **words and gestures**. You cannot cast if gagged, bound, or unable to move/speak freely.
- **Concentration:** If maintaining a spell, any damage or significant disturbance (Referee's call) forces a **CON save (DC 12)** or the spell ends.

---

## Recovery
- **Breather (10 min):** No slot recovery.
- **Night's Rest (8 hr):** Restore all slots; may change prepared spells.
- **Safe Haven (1d4 + 1 days):** Full reset — HP, slots, Fatigue.

## Ritual Casting

Spells marked with **{Ritual}** can be cast without expending a slot:
- Add **10 minutes** to the casting time
- The spell does **not** need to be prepared (the ritual IS the preparation)
- The spell slot is **not** consumed

Ritual casting is slower but conserves resources for exploration and utility magic.
