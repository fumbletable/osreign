## Armor Tags

**Proficiency tiers** - your class grants proficiency with Light, Medium, and/or Heavy armor.

**How it works:**
- **Light** - Full DEX bonus to AC
- **Medium** - DEX bonus to AC capped at +2
- **Heavy** - No DEX bonus to AC; Stealth checks have **Setback**

**Restrictions:**
- **Bulky** - Counts as 2 slots for encumbrance
- **Min STR** - If you don't meet the requirement, your Speed drops one step (Normal → Slow)

**Special:**
- **Sunder** - When you take damage, you can destroy your shield to reduce that damage to 0

## Sleeping in Armor

If you sleep in Heavy armor, make a CON save (Easy DC 8). Fail and you gain no benefit from the rest.
