# Ancestry

Choose one of the four core ancestries for your character.

- Everyone speaks **Common** plus their ancestry's tongue (Humans just speak Common).
- **Bonus languages:** If your INT is positive, you gain that many extra languages.
- Each ancestry has 3 traits. One is marked **Essential** (core to old-school play). The other two can vary for sub-ancestries.
