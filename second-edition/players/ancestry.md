# Ancestry

Your ancestry is where you come from—and what you can do that others can't.

Choose one of the four core ancestries for your character.

- Everyone speaks **Common** plus their ancestry's tongue (Humans just speak Common).
- **Bonus languages:** If your INT is positive, you gain that many extra languages.
- Each ancestry has 2–3 traits. These can vary for sub-ancestries.

## Dwarf
**Size:** Medium · **Languages:** Common, Dwarvish
**Age:** Adult ~40 · Lifespan ~250–400

- **Stone Sense:** You detect unusual stonework. If you pass within 5 ft of slopes, seams, traps, or recent masonry, the Referee may roll a secret INT check for you. When you actively search stonework, roll with **Edge**.
- **Darkvision (30 ft).**
- **Resist Spells:** **Edge** on saves vs spells and spell-like effects.

*Restriction:* Dwarves' innate magic resistance means you can't take Magic-User levels unless the Referee permits an exception.

**Age:** Adult ~100 · Lifespan ~400–1000+
