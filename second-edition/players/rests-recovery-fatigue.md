# Rests, Recovery & Fatigue

Adventuring is exhausting. Here's how you push through—and what happens when you can't.

---

## Fatigue

Fatigue tracks exhaustion. You gain levels of Fatigue when pushed beyond your limits.

| Level | Effect |
|------:|--------|
| 1 | −1 to all checks and saves |
| 2 | −2 to all checks and saves |
| 3 | −3 to all checks and saves; Speed drops one step |
| 4 | −4 to all checks and saves; Speed drops to Slow |
| 5 | Incapacitated—can't act until you rest |

### Gaining Fatigue

When you're pushed beyond your limits, roll **CON save (DC 12)**. On a failure, gain +1 Fatigue.

Common triggers:
- Forced march (extra Watch of travel)
- Sleeping in heavy armor
- No food or water
- Soaked and cold, or blazing heat
- Long swims or climbs in armor
- Toxic fumes or bad air

Extreme conditions use DC 16. Proper gear or shelter gives EDGE. Severe conditions give SETBACK.

**Dropped in combat:** If you drop to 0 HP, you gain 1 Fatigue automatically when you get back up. No save—getting knocked out takes a toll.

## Breather (10 minutes)

After a fight, you can catch your breath. Spend **1 Supply** and choose one:

- **Heal:** Regain `1d4 + CON` HP.
- **Shake it off:** Roll CON save (DC 12) to remove 1 Fatigue.

If an ally spends the Breather tending to you, you can do both.

---

## Night's Rest (8 hours)

A full night of sleep in reasonable conditions.

**Healing:** Spend any number of your Hit Dice. For each die spent, roll it and add CON to the result. Regain that many HP. Spent Hit Dice don't return until you reach a Safe Haven.

**Magic:** Regain all spell slots. You may change prepared spells.

**Fatigue:** Remove 2 levels if you have food and shelter. Remove 1 if you're roughing it.

*Shelter means protection from the elements. A tent or building counts. A bedroll under clear skies counts. A bedroll in a storm doesn't.*

---

## Safe Haven (1d4+1 days)

Extended rest in a safe, comfortable location—a town, friendly keep, or secure camp far from danger.

- **Full reset:** All HP, Hit Dice, spell slots, and Fatigue restored.
- **Injuries:** Minor injuries clear automatically. Major injuries need treatment or magic.

The variable duration means you can't plan exactly when you'll be ready. Sometimes the dungeon won't wait.
