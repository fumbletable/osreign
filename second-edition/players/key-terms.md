# Key Terms

The vocabulary you'll see throughout this book.

---

## Ranges

How far things are from you.

| Range | Distance | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Close** | Within 5 ft | Melee range, a whisper |
| **Near** | Within 30 ft | Thrown weapons, normal conversation |
| **Far** | 30–120 ft | Bows and crossbows, a shout |
| **Very Far** | Beyond 120 ft | Out of weapon range, often out of sight |

---

## Speeds

How fast you move.

| Speed | Per Round | Notes |
|-------|----------:|-------|
| **Slow** | 15 ft | Sneaking, encumbered, difficult terrain |
| **Normal** | 30 ft | Standard movement |
| **Fast** | 45 ft | Unencumbered, urgent |

Heavy armor, overloaded packs, or difficult conditions drop your Speed by one step.

---

## Time

How long things take.

| Unit | Duration | When You Use It |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Round** | 6 seconds | Combat—one turn per combatant |
| **Turn** | 10 minutes | Dungeon exploration—searching, picking locks |
| **Watch** | 6 hours | Wilderness travel, long rests (4 Watches = 1 day) |

---

## Rests

How you recover.

| Rest Type | Duration | What You Get |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Breather** | 10 minutes | Spend Hit Dice to heal, clear 1 Fatigue |
| **Night's Rest** | 8 hours | Regain half your Hit Dice, clear all Fatigue |
| **Safe Haven** | 1 week in safety | Full HP, all Hit Dice, remove lingering conditions |

Rests require 1 **Supply** per person (food, water, bandages).

---

## Resources

What you track and spend.

| Resource | What It Is |
|----------|------------|
| **Supply** | Abstract provisions—food, water, bandages. Spend 1 per rest. |
| **Fatigue** | Exhaustion from forced marches, missed sleep, harsh conditions. Each level gives **Setback** on all rolls. 5 Fatigue = collapse. |
| **Hit Dice** | Your recovery pool. Spend during Breathers to heal (roll + CON per die). |
| **Boost Die** | Personal resource for clutch moments. Add d6 to any roll. |

---

## Conditions

States that affect you.

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Prone** | **Setback** on attacks. Melee attacks against you have **Edge**. Stand up costs half your movement. |
| **Grappled** | Speed 0. Can't move until you break free (contest of STR). |
| **Frightened** | **Setback** on checks and attacks while you can see the source. Can't willingly move closer. |
| **Blinded** | Can't see. Auto-fail sight-based checks. Attacks have **Setback**, attacks against you have **Edge**. |
| **Deafened** | Can't hear. Auto-fail hearing-based checks. |
| **Poisoned** | **Setback** on attacks and checks. |
| **Stunned** | Can't act or move. Auto-fail STR and DEX saves. Attacks against you have **Edge**. |
| **Incapacitated** | Can't take actions or reactions. |
| **Unconscious** | Incapacitated, can't move or speak, unaware. Drop whatever you're holding, fall **Prone**. |
