# Key Terms

The vocabulary you'll see throughout this book.

---

## Ranges

How far things are from you.

| Range | Distance | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Close** | Within 5 ft | Melee range, a whisper |
| **Near** | Within 30 ft | Thrown weapons, normal conversation |
| **Far** | 30–120 ft | Bows and crossbows, a shout |
| **Very Far** | Beyond 120 ft | Out of weapon range, often out of sight |

---

## Speeds

Your Speed category—set by ancestry, feats, or creature type.

| Speed | Per Round | Notes |
|-------|----------:|-------|
| **Slow** | 15 ft | Heavily encumbered, some creatures |
| **Normal** | 30 ft | Most characters and creatures |
| **Fast** | 45 ft | Some feats, fast creatures |

Encumbrance or difficult terrain drops your Speed by one step.

---

## Time

How long things take.

| Unit | Duration | When You Use It |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Round** | 6 seconds | Combat—one turn per combatant |
| **Turn** | 10 minutes | Dungeon exploration—searching, picking locks |
| **Watch** | 4 hours | Wilderness travel, rests (6 Watches = 1 day) |

---

## Rests

How you recover.

| Rest Type | Duration | What You Get |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Breather** | 10 minutes | Heal 1d4+CON HP **or** CON save (DC 12) to clear 1 Fatigue. Choose one. |
| **Night's Rest** | 8 hours | Spend Hit Dice to heal (roll + CON each). Clear 2 Fatigue (shelter) or 1 (roughing it). |
| **Safe Haven** | 1d4+1 days | Full HP, all Hit Dice, all spell slots, all Fatigue cleared. |

Breathers require 1 **Supply**. Hit Dice only recover at Safe Haven.

---

## Resources

What you track and spend.

| Resource | What It Is |
|----------|------------|
| **Supply** | Abstract provisions—food, water, bandages. Spend 1 per Breather, 1 per day for food. |
| **Fatigue** | Exhaustion levels (1–5). Each level is −1 to all checks and saves. At 3+ your Speed drops to Slow. At 5 you're Incapacitated. |
| **Hit Dice** | Your recovery pool (one per level). Spend during Night's Rest to heal (roll + CON each). Only recover at Safe Haven. |
| **Boost Die** | Start each session with PB. Spend 1 to add 1d6 to any roll, or use for class abilities. Gain 1 on a natural 1. No maximum. |

---

## Conditions

States that affect you.

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Blinded** | Can't see. Auto-fail sight-based checks. Attacks have **Setback**, attacks against you have **Edge**. |
| **Charmed** | Regard the charmer as a trusted ally. Can't attack them. Hostile acts break the effect. |
| **Deafened** | Can't hear. Auto-fail hearing-based checks. |
| **Frightened** | **Setback** on checks and attacks while you can see the source. Can't willingly move closer. |
| **Grappled** | Speed 0. Break free with STR or DEX vs grappler's STR. |
| **Incapacitated** | Can't take actions or reactions. |
| **Paralyzed** | Can't move, speak, or act. Attacks against you have **Edge** and auto-crit from **Close**. |
| **Poisoned** | **Setback** on attacks and checks. |
| **Prone** | **Setback** on attacks. Melee attacks against you have **Edge**; ranged attacks have **Setback**. Stand up costs half movement. |
| **Restrained** | Speed 0, your attacks have **Setback**, attacks against you have **Edge**. |
| **Shaken** | **Setback** on attacks and checks. Ends after a Breather or when the source is defeated. |
| **Stunned** | Can't act or move. Auto-fail STR and DEX saves. Attacks against you have **Edge**. |
| **Unconscious** | Incapacitated, can't move or speak, unaware. Drop what you're holding, fall **Prone**. |
