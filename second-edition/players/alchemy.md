# Alchemy

Extract monster essences and craft them into potions and poisons.

---

## Requirements

To practice alchemy, you need:

- **Alchemist** feat (for potions) or **Poisoner** feat (for poisons)
- **Alchemist's Supplies** or **Poisoner's Kit** (50 gp, 10 uses)
- **Supply** (base material)
- **A clean environment** (camp, shelter, or better—not mid-dungeon)

The kit includes binders, bottles, and reagents. When it's empty, buy another.

## What Can Be Harvested?

If a creature has a special ability that forces a saving throw, you can probably harvest something from it.

| Source | Element |
|--------|---------|
| Basilisk eyes | Petrification |
| Giant spider venom sacs | Poison |
| Fire beetle glands | Light |
| Ghast glands | Paralysis, stench |
| Black pudding residue | Acid |
| Gelatinous cube slime | Paralysis |
| Dragon breath glands | Fire, cold, lightning, etc. |

This extends beyond monsters. Toxic mushrooms, venomous plants, dungeon slimes—if it forces a save, it likely has something worth extracting.

---

## Harvesting

After killing a creature with a harvestable ability, anyone can attempt to extract the element.

**Roll:** INT or WIS check vs DC (based on creature HD)

| Creature HD | DC |
|-------------|-----|
| 1–4 | 8 |
| 5–8 | 12 |
| 9–12 | 16 |
| 13+ | 20 |

**Success:** You harvest essences equal to the creature's HD.

**Failure:** The element is ruined. Nothing recovered.

**Time:** 1 Turn (10 minutes).

The Alchemist and Poisoner feats grant **Edge** on this check.

---

## Essences

Essences are raw, unstable material. They won't keep forever—use them or lose them.

**Shelf life:** Essences spoil after 1 week unless preserved (referee's discretion for preservation methods).

Combine essences into a single potion or poison for greater potency:

| Essences Used | Effect DC |
|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | DC 8 |
| 2 | DC 12 |
| 3 | DC 16 |

You choose how many essences to use when crafting.

---

## Crafting

Crafting requires the **Alchemist** feat (for potions) or **Poisoner** feat (for poisons).

**Requirements:**
- The appropriate feat
- A safe environment (see below)
- 1 **Supply** per essence used
- 1 **kit use** per essence used

**Environment affects the roll:**

| Environment | Modifier |
|-------------|----------|
| Camp or shelter | **Setback** |
| Town workshop | Normal |
| Laboratory | **Edge** |

**Time:** 1 Watch (4 hours) per essence used.

**Roll:** INT check vs DC (based on the creature's HD, not the potency you're creating)

**Success:** You create the potion or poison. It delivers the creature's effect at the DC you chose.

**Failure:** The essences are lost. Supply and kit uses are consumed.

**No feat?** Sell your essences to an alchemist in town, or find someone with the skill.

---

## Using Potions and Poisons

**Potions:** Drink as a free action on your turn. Effect is immediate.

**Poisons:** Apply to a weapon (1 action). The next hit with that weapon delivers the poison. Target makes a CON save vs the poison's DC.

**Doses:** Each potion or poison is single-use.

---

## Example: Basilisk

A party kills a basilisk (HD 6, DC 12 creature).

**Harvest:** The alchemist rolls INT vs DC 12. Success—they extract 6 essences.

**Craft options:**
- Six DC 8 potions (6 essences, 6 Supply, 6 kit uses)
- Three DC 12 potions (6 essences, 6 Supply, 6 kit uses)
- Two DC 16 potions (6 essences, 6 Supply, 6 kit uses)

They choose two DC 16 potions. Each uses 3 essences, 3 Supply, and 3 kit uses. That's 6 essences, 6 Supply, 6 kit uses total—plus 6 Watches (24 hours) of work.

They make two INT checks vs DC 12 (one per potion). Each success produces a potion that forces DC 16 CON or petrification.
