## Merge / Notes

- ~~Keen Hearing, Sight, Smell~~ → **RESOLVED: Merged into Keen Senses (pick one sense)**
- Animal feats → feel broadly useful (companions, pets), but double well as Fighter/Expert options.
- Divine Sense / Aura of Courage → could be folded into Paladin archetypes, but fine as General.
