# How to Play

When the outcome's uncertain, you roll dice.

## Checks

Roll d20 + ability + Proficiency Bonus (PB) if it applies. Meet or beat the Difficulty Class (DC) and you succeed. Fall short and something goes wrong—but never a dead end. Every roll should push the story forward.

**Proficiency Bonus (PB):** Your proficiency bonus represents training and natural talent—things your character is actually good at. You add it to attacks with weapons you're proficient in, saving throws your class grants proficiency in, and skill checks that fit your class, background, or feats. Your PB starts at +2 (levels 1–4), increases to +3 (levels 5–8), and caps at +4 (levels 9–12).

## Saving Throws

When something nasty happens to you—a trap springs, a spell hits, the floor gives way—you make a saving throw. Roll d20 + ability (+ PB if you're proficient in that save). Your class grants proficiency in certain saves—check your class description. Meet or beat the DC and you avoid or reduce the harm. Fail and it hits you full force.

*Example: Poison gas fills the room. CON save to resist.*

## Difficulty Classes

| DC | Difficulty | Example |
|---:|------------|---------|
| 8 | Easy | Climb a knotted rope |
| 12 | Normal | Cross a narrow ledge |
| 16 | Hard | Decipher ancient text |
| 20 | Extreme | Reserved for legendary feats or powerful monsters |

Most checks are DC 12. The Referee sets the DC based on how hard the task actually is, and may adjust it for circumstances.

## Contests

When you're directly opposing someone—arm wrestling, grappling, a tug-of-war—both sides roll. Highest total wins. On a tie, nothing changes (or the Referee adds a small complication).

---

## Group Checks

When the whole party attempts something together, everyone rolls. If at least half succeed, the group succeeds.

---

## Edge and Setback

When circumstances favor you, you have **Edge**—add 1d6 to your roll.

When circumstances work against you, you have **Setback**—subtract 1d6 from your roll.

**Edge** and **Setback** can stack. Two sources of **Edge** means +2d6. One **Edge** and one **Setback** cancel out.

## Boost Dice

Boost Dice are a personal resource you spend to enhance your actions. You start each session with Boost Dice equal to your **PB**. There's no maximum—earn as many as you can during play. They don't carry over between sessions—use them or lose them.

**Basic use:** Spend 1 Boost Die to add 1d6 to any roll. Declare it before or after you roll.

**Recovery:** When you roll a natural 1 on any d20 roll, gain 1 Boost Die. Failure teaches.

**Earning more:** The Referee may award Boost Dice when you play up your hindrances (character flaws—see [Hindrances](character/hindrances)), do something memorable, or make the game more fun.

**Class abilities:** Each class also has special ways to spend Boost Dice—see your class description for details.

## General Principles

**Specific beats general.** If a feat, spell, or item contradicts a broader rule, the specific one wins.

**Round down.** Always. HP, XP, damage—if there's a fraction, drop it.
