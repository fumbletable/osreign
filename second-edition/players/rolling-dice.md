# Rolling Dice

When the outcome's uncertain, you roll dice.

## Checks

Roll d20 + your ability modifier (+ proficiency bonus if it applies). Beat the Difficulty Class (DC) and you succeed. Fall short and something goes wrong - but never a dead end. Every roll should push the story forward.

---

## Saving Throws

When something nasty happens fast - a trap springs, a spell hits, the floor gives way - you make a saving throw. Roll d20 + the relevant ability mod (+ proficiency if you've got it). Beat the DC and you avoid or reduce the harm. Fail and it hits you full force.

*Example: Poison gas fills the room. CON save to resist.*

## Difficulty Classes

| DC | Difficulty | Example |
|---:|------------|---------|
| 8 | Easy | Climb a knotted rope |
| 12 | Normal | Cross a narrow ledge |
| 16 | Hard | Decipher ancient text |

Most checks are DC 12. The Referee sets the DC based on how hard the task actually is.

## Contests

When you're directly opposing someone - arm wrestling, grappling, a tug-of-war - both sides roll. Highest total wins. On a tie, nothing changes (or the Referee adds a small complication).

---

## Group Checks

When the whole party attempts something together, everyone rolls. If at least half succeed, the group succeeds. You can skip your roll to give a teammate EDGE on theirs instead.

---

## Passive Checks

Sometimes rolling would slow things down. Your passive score is 10 + ability mod (+ proficiency if your background applies). The Referee uses this when you're not actively trying - like noticing a tripwire you weren't looking for.

## General Principles

**Specific beats general.** If a feat, spell, or item contradicts a broader rule, the specific one wins.

**Round down.** Always. HP, XP, damage - if there's a fraction, drop it.
