## Core Rules

### Rolling Dice
- **Checks:** Roll `d20 + ability modifier (+ proficiency if it applies)`.
- **Success:** Total ≥ Difficulty Class (DC).
- **Failure:** Total < DC → introduces a consequence or complication (never a dead end).
- Each roll should shape the story with new challenges or opportunities.

---

### Saving Throws
- Used for sudden threats (traps, spells, hazards).
- Roll `d20 + relevant ability modifier (+ proficiency if it applies)`.
- **Success:** Avoid or reduce harm.
- **Failure:** Harmful effect applies.
- Example: Resisting poison gas = CON save.

---

### Difficulty Classes
- **Easy (8):** straightforward tasks (climb a knotted rope).
- **Normal (12):** standard challenge (cross a narrow ledge).
- **Hard (16):** difficult tasks (decipher ancient text).

---

### Contests
- Opposed rolls when two forces directly conflict.
- Both roll; higher total wins.
- Tie: status quo holds, or Referee adds a small complication.
- Example: Grappling an enemy = opposed STR checks.

---

### Group Checks
- If at least half succeed, the group succeeds.
- Anyone may forgo rolling to grant a teammate **EDGE** instead.

---

### Passive Checks
- Passive = `10 + ability modifier (+ PB if background/knack clearly applies)`.
- Used when rolling would slow play.
- Example: Passive Perception 14 notices a hidden tripwire.

---

### General Principles
- **Specific beats General:** If a rule (feat, spell, item) conflicts with a broader rule, the specific one wins.
  - Example: A magical feat granting martial weapon proficiency overrides a general restriction.
- **Round Down:** Always round fractions down (HP, SP, XP, etc.).
