# Rolling Dice

When the outcome's uncertain, you roll dice.

## Checks

Roll d20 + ability + Proficiency Bonus (PB) if it applies. Beat the Difficulty Class (DC) and you succeed. Fall short and something goes wrong—but never a dead end. Every roll should push the story forward.

---

## Saving Throws

When something nasty happens to you—a trap springs, a spell hits, the floor gives way—you make a saving throw. Roll d20 + ability (+ PB if you've got it). Beat the DC and you avoid or reduce the harm. Fail and it hits you full force.

*Example: Poison gas fills the room. CON save to resist.*

## Difficulty Classes

| DC | Difficulty | Example |
|---:|------------|---------|
| 8 | Easy | Climb a knotted rope |
| 12 | Normal | Cross a narrow ledge |
| 16 | Hard | Decipher ancient text |

Most checks are DC 12. The Referee sets the DC based on how hard the task actually is, and may adjust it for circumstances.

---

## Contests

When you're directly opposing someone—arm wrestling, grappling, a tug-of-war—both sides roll. Highest total wins. On a tie, nothing changes (or the Referee adds a small complication).

---

## Group Checks

When the whole party attempts something together, everyone rolls. If at least half succeed, the group succeeds.

---

## EDGE and SETBACK

When circumstances favor you, you have **EDGE**—add 1d6 to your roll.

When circumstances work against you, you have **SETBACK**—subtract 1d6 from your roll.

EDGE and SETBACK can stack. Two sources of EDGE means +2d6. One EDGE and one SETBACK cancel out.

## Boost Dice

Boost Dice are a personal resource you spend to enhance your actions. You start each session with **half your PB** (minimum 1) Boost Dice. They don't carry over—use them or lose them.

**Basic use:** Spend 1 Boost Die to add 1d6 to any roll. Declare it before or after you roll.

**Earning more:** The Referee may award Boost Dice when you play up your hindrances, do something memorable, or make the game more fun.

**Class abilities:** Each class also has special ways to spend Boost Dice—see your class description for details.

## General Principles

**Specific beats general.** If a feat, spell, or item contradicts a broader rule, the specific one wins.

**Round down.** Always. HP, XP, damage—if there's a fraction, drop it.
