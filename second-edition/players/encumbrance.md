# Encumbrance

How much you can carry.

---

## Slots

You have **10 + STR** item slots. A backpack adds 10 more (lose the backpack, lose those slots).

**What takes a slot:**
- Most items that don't fit in your palm = 1 slot
- **Bulky** items (plate armor, greataxe, maul, etc.) = 2 slots
- 100 coins = 1 slot

**Containers:**
- **Backpack** — +10 slots (worn)
- **Sack** — +5 slots (requires a free hand)

---

## Over Capacity

If you exceed your slots:
- Your Speed drops to **Slow**
- Roll a **CON save (DC 12)** when you pick up the extra load. Fail = **+1 Fatigue**
- If you increase your load further while already over capacity, roll again

If you exceed **double** your slots, you're **immobile** until you drop something.
