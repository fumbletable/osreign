# Encumbrance

How much you can carry.

---

## Carry Limit

You have **10 + STR** item slots. A backpack adds 10 more.

**Bulky items** take 2 slots. Gear, weapons, or armor tagged *Bulky* counts double.

---

## Over Capacity

If you exceed your slots, your Speed drops to **Slow** and you roll a **CON save (DC 12)**. Fail and you gain **+1 Fatigue**.

If you're carrying more than double your slots, you're **immobile** until you drop something.
