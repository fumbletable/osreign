# Classes

OSwR has four base classes: [Cleric](cleric/), [Expert](expert/), [Fighter](fighter/), [Magic-User](magic-user/).
Your class sets hit points, proficient saves, weapon/armor proficiencies, and what you gain on level-ups.

This small set is by design. The mix of **Feats** and **multiclassing** lets you shape almost any archetype you want:

- A **Ranger** can grow out of an Expert with wilderness Feats.
- A **Paladin** might be a Fighter with divine Feats, or a multiclass Fighter/Cleric.
- A **Bard** emerges from an Expert with social and magic Feats.
- A **Monk** can be built from an Expert focused on discipline, agility, and unarmed combat Feats.

Rather than dozens of rigid classes, OSwR gives you four broad frameworks and the tools to build the character you imagine.

## How to Read Class Lines
- **HD:** At 1st level, you take the max of your HD (8 for Fighter, 6 for Cleric/Expert, 4 for Magic-User) + CON.
  At higher levels, roll your class Hit Die (or take the average in parentheses) and add CON.
- **Saves:** These are your proficient saves—add PB and the ability mod. Non-proficient saves use only the ability mod.
- **Weapons / Armor:** Listed by **tags**. Add PB to attacks with proficient weapons. Shields give their normal AC bonus.
  Some restrictions apply (e.g., Cleric "Bludgeoning only").
- **Ability Boost:** At level 1, your class grants +1 to a specific ability score.
- **Spellcasters:** Cleric & Magic-User use **Spell Slots** with prepared lists. See [Magic Overview](../magic/) for preparation and casting.
