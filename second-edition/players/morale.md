# Morale

Not everything fights to the death. When the situation turns grim, creatures may flee, surrender, or break.

---

## When to Check

Roll morale when:

- **First blood:** The first ally falls
- **Half down:** Half the group is out of the fight
- **Leader killed:** The boss, champion, or commander drops
- **Overwhelming odds:** Reinforcements arrive, or the situation shifts dramatically against them

The Referee may also call for a check when something terrifying happens (dragon breathes fire, magic backfires spectacularly, etc.).

---

## The Roll

Roll **2d6** and compare to the creature's **Morale score (Ml)**.

| Result | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| **Over Ml** | They break — flee, surrender, or scatter |
| **Equal or under** | They hold — fight continues |
| **Natural 12** | Rally — no more checks this fight unless something far worse happens |

---

## Morale Scores

| Ml | Typical Creatures |
|---:|-------------------|
| 2 | Cowards, non-combatants forced to fight |
| 5 | Poorly motivated, mercenaries with no stake |
| 7 | Average — goblins, bandits, hired guards |
| 9 | Disciplined — trained soldiers, pack predators |
| 10 | Fanatics, apex predators, undead |
| 12 | Fearless — will never flee (golems, demons, the utterly devoted) |

Every monster stat block includes an Ml score.

## Retainer Morale

Retainers use the same 2d6 roll, but add modifiers:

**Roll:** 2d6 + Loyalty mod + Retainer modifier

- **8+** — they hold
- **12** — rally (no more checks this fight)
- **Fail** — withdraw, flee, or break

See [Retainers](../refereeing/retainers/) for Loyalty tracking and the Retainer modifier table.

---

## What Happens When They Break?

The Referee decides based on the creature and situation:

- **Flee** — run for the nearest exit, drop heavy items
- **Surrender** — throw down weapons, beg for mercy
- **Scatter** — each creature runs in a different direction
- **Fighting retreat** — back away while defending, looking for escape

Intelligent creatures may negotiate. Mindless creatures may simply stop fighting and wander. Animals bolt.

---

## Pursuing Fleeing Enemies

If the party pursues:

- **Faster than the enemy:** Catch them automatically
- **Same speed:** Contest — DEX check vs DEX, or the Referee rules based on terrain
- **Slower:** They escape unless the party has ranged attacks or other advantages

Fleeing creatures may lead pursuers into traps, ambushes, or their lair.

---

## Optional: Player Character Morale

Player characters don't check morale — players decide when to run. However, hirelings, animal companions, and summoned creatures do check.

If you want to add tension, a Referee may call for a **WIS save (DC 12)** when something truly terrifying happens. Failure means the character is **Shaken** (SETBACK on attacks) until they spend a Breather recovering.
