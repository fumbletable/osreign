# Fighter Feats (Draft Review)

These feats are tagged **Fighter**. Some could be broadened to Expert, or even General.

---

## Core Fighter (stay Fighter)

## Core Fighter (continued)

- Ambush Hunter — 1st round, +1d6 damage. *(Fighter-only; ranger/hunter flavor)*
- Brawler — PB to unarmed/grapple checks. *(fits Monk concept)*
- Deflect Missiles — +3 AC vs ranged. *(could be Monk/Expert too)*
- Eagle Eye — Mark target, EDGE on ranged. *(ranger/archer vibe)*
- Feint — After Dodge, EDGE +1d6 dmg next melee. *(fencer/duelist vibe)*
- Quick Reflexes — Add PB to Initiative. *(could be General)*
- Skirmisher — Move half Speed without provoking. *(fits rogue-ish mobility)*
- Whirlwind Attack — Attack all CLOSE foes (1/Day). *(Expert "swashbuckler" too)*

---

## General-leaning (could be moved or duplicated)

- Endurance Training — +2 fatigue buffer. *(already a General Endurance feat?)*
- Precision Strike — Spend BD to add +1d6 to attack. *(fits Fighter but overlaps Boost system)*
- Second Wind — Heal 1d6+CON once/combat. *(survivability, could be General)*
- Tactician's Shout — Allies NEAR gain EDGE 1 round. *(already a General Tactician feat)*

## Overlaps / Redundancies

- ~~**Cutting Edge** vs **Savage Attacker**~~ → **RESOLVED: Cutting Edge (Fighter-only, 1/turn must take reroll), Savage Attacker cut**
- ~~**Enduring Fighter** vs **Tough (General)**~~ → **RESOLVED: Enduring Fighter cut, keep Tough (passive) + Second Wind (active)**
- ~~**Indomitable / Unyielding / Iron Will**~~ → **RESOLVED: All cut, replaced by General Resilience (1/day reroll any failed save)**
- **Adrenaline Rush / Second Wind / Heroic Destiny (General)** — similar "one big extra action/avoid death" powers. Decide tone.

---

## Notes

- Many feats here feel like they overlap with *modern 5E maneuvers* (Adrenaline Rush, Whirlwind, Second Wind). Decide whether to keep the "cinematic" feel or trim down to old-school simplicity.
- Several could be shared with **Experts** to enable Monk/Swashbuckler builds.
- Some duplicates already exist in General → need to unify (damage rerolls, HP buffs, save rerolls).
