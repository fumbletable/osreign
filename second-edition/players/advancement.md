# Advancement

OSwR characters advance from level 1 to 12. Each level grants new abilities, and higher levels open access to feats and spell tiers—but these must be earned through training and research.

---

## Experience Points (XP)

Characters earn XP from **treasure recovered** and **monsters overcome**.

### Treasure XP

**1 XP per 1 GP** of treasure recovered from dangerous locations and returned to civilisation.

Treasure must be won through risk. Coins earned through honest work or trade don't count—only wealth pulled from dungeons, ruins, lairs, and other perilous places.

> **Why treasure?** XP for gold creates emergent gameplay. Players sneak past the dragon because fighting is risky and the hoard is what matters. They negotiate with goblins because dead goblins don't lead to treasure. The system rewards clever play without the Referee deciding what counts as "clever."

### Monster XP

Monsters grant XP using the formula: **HD² × 10**

"Overcome" includes defeating, outsmarting, driving off, or otherwise neutralising the threat. You don't have to kill it—you have to deal with it.

| HD | XP |
|---:|---:|
| 1 | 10 |
| 2 | 40 |
| 3 | 90 |
| 4 | 160 |
| 5 | 250 |
| 6 | 360 |
| 8 | 640 |
| 10 | 1,000 |

Add **+10 XP per special ability** for monsters with unusual powers.

### Dividing XP

Divide all XP evenly among surviving party members, including retainers who fought alongside you (they typically receive a half share).

## XP by Level

| Level | XP Required | Cumulative |
|------:|------------:|-----------:|
| 1 | — | 0 |
| 2 | 1,500 | 1,500 |
| 3 | 3,000 | 4,500 |
| 4 | 4,500 | 9,000 |
| 5 | 9,000 | 18,000 |
| 6 | 18,000 | 36,000 |
| 7 | 24,000 | 60,000 |
| 8 | 40,000 | 100,000 |
| 9 | 50,000 | 150,000 |
| 10 | 75,000 | 225,000 |
| 11 | 75,000 | 300,000 |
| 12 | 75,000 | 375,000 |

**Level cap:** OSwR ends at level 12. Beyond this, characters enter domain play—land, titles, strongholds, and influence.

## Unified Cadence

All classes follow the same advancement pattern:

- **Odd levels (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11):** Class feature advancement
  - Fighter → +1 Fighter Feat
  - Expert → +1 Expert Feat
  - Cleric → unlocks next spell tier (1–6)
  - Magic-User → unlocks next spell tier (1–6)
- **Even levels (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12):** +1 General Feat
- **Levels 4, 8, 12:** +1 to any ability modifier (maximum +5)
- **Multiclassing:** May only add a new class at odd levels

---

## Proficiency Bonus (PB)

| Level | PB |
|------:|---:|
| 1–4 | +2 |
| 5–8 | +3 |
| 9–12 | +4 |

PB applies to attacks with proficient weapons, proficient saves, and checks involving class, background, or feat abilities.

---

## Training Costs

Levelling up grants the *capacity* for new abilities. Actually gaining them requires time and gold.

### Feats

To learn a new feat (class or general):
- **Time:** 1 week of dedicated training
- **Cost:** 500 gp (equipment, practice, study)

No trainer required—the character trains independently or seeks instruction as part of the fiction.

### Spells

See [Spellbooks & Research](spellbooks-and-research/) for full rules. In summary:
- **Copying a spell:** 1 day/tier, 100 gp/tier
- **Researching a spell:** 1 week/tier, 700 gp/week, INT check

Casters unlock new spell *tiers* at odd levels, but must still acquire individual spells through play.

### Ability Score Increases

Ability increases at levels 4, 8, and 12 are **free**—no gold or time required.

## Converting Old Modules

OSwR is designed to work with classic modules (B/X, OSE, BFRPG) with minimal conversion:

- **Treasure:** Use as written. 1 GP = 1 XP.
- **Monster XP:** Use OSwR formula (HD² × 10) instead of listed values.

For 5e modules, treasure values are typically lower—adjust as needed or treat magic item values as treasure.
