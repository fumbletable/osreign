# Advancement

OSwR characters advance from level 1 to 12. This is a game about adventurers, not superheroes—even at high levels, a sword to the gut is dangerous and caution keeps you alive.

---

## Experience Points (XP)

Characters earn XP from **treasure recovered** and **monsters overcome**.

### Treasure XP

**1 XP per 1 GP** of treasure recovered from dangerous locations and returned to civilisation.

Treasure must be won through risk. Coins earned through honest work or trade don't count—only wealth pulled from dungeons, ruins, lairs, and other perilous places.

> **Why treasure?** XP for gold creates emergent gameplay. Players sneak past the dragon because fighting is risky and the hoard is what matters. They negotiate with goblins because dead goblins don't lead to treasure. The system rewards clever play without the Referee deciding what counts as "clever."

### Monster XP

Monsters grant XP using the formula: **HD² × 10**

"Overcome" includes defeating, outsmarting, driving off, or otherwise neutralising the threat. You don't have to kill it—you have to deal with it.

### Dividing XP

Divide all XP evenly among surviving party members, including [retainers](hiring-help) who fought alongside you (they typically receive a half share).

## Unified Cadence

All classes follow the same advancement pattern:

- **Odd levels (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11):** Class feature advancement
  - Fighter → +1 Fighter Feat
  - Expert → +1 Expert or General Feat
  - Cleric → unlocks next spell tier (1–6)
  - Magic-User → unlocks next spell tier (1–6)
- **Even levels (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12):** +1 General Feat
- **Levels 4, 8, 12:** +1 to any ability modifier (maximum +5)
- **Multiclassing:** May only add a new class at odd levels (see [Multiclassing](#multiclassing) below)

---

## Proficiency Bonus (PB)

| Level | PB |
|------:|---:|
| 1–4 | +2 |
| 5–8 | +3 |
| 9–12 | +4 |

PB applies to attacks with proficient weapons, proficient saves, and checks involving class, background, or feat abilities.

## Training Costs

Levelling up grants the *capacity* for new abilities. Actually gaining them requires time and gold.

### Feats

To learn a new feat (class or general):
- **Time:** 1 week of dedicated training
- **Cost:** 500 gp (equipment, practice, study)

No trainer required—the character trains independently or seeks instruction as part of the fiction.

### Spells

See [Spellbooks & Research](spellbooks-and-research.md) for full rules. In summary:
- **Copying a spell:** 1 day/tier, 100 gp/tier
- **Researching a spell:** 1 week/tier, 700 gp/week, INT check

Casters unlock new spell *tiers* at odd levels, but must still acquire individual spells through play.

### Ability Score Increases

Ability increases at levels 4, 8, and 12 are **free**—no gold or time required.

---

## Multiclassing

You can take levels in multiple classes, gaining their abilities at the cost of slower progression in each.

### Rules

- **Odd levels only:** You may only switch to a different class at odd character levels (3, 5, 7, 9, 11). This means you commit to at least two levels before you can switch again.
- **Proficiency Bonus:** Your PB is based on your total adventurer level, not individual class levels.
- **Proficiencies:** You gain all proficiencies (weapons, armour, saves) of your new class. However, proficiency doesn't override class restrictions—a Magic-User who takes Fighter levels gains armour proficiency but still can't cast spells in armour without the Armoured Caster feat.
- **Hit Dice:** Your Hit Dice pool is the sum of all dice gained from your class levels. You can spend these dice in any combination when resting or using abilities that require Hit Dice.
- **Spell tiers:** You unlock spell tiers based on your levels in each casting class separately. Three Cleric levels unlocks Tier 2 divine spells; two Magic-User levels only unlocks Tier 1 arcane spells.
- **Spell slots:** Each casting class has its own spell slot progression based on your levels in that class. They don't combine.

### Example

*Aldric starts as a Fighter. At level 3, he switches to Magic-User. At level 5, he continues as Magic-User. He's now a 5th-level adventurer with 2d8 + 3d4 Hit Dice, two Fighter Feats, one General Feat, and access to Tier 2 arcane spells. He has all Fighter weapon and armour proficiencies—but can't cast spells while wearing armour unless he takes the Armoured Caster feat.*
