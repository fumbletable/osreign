# Exploration Basics

Adventuring isn't just combat. Much of your time will be spent exploring dangerous places, managing resources, and making decisions about how to proceed.

---

## Time in the Dungeon

Underground, time is tracked in **Turns** (about 10 minutes each).

In a Turn, you can:
- Move cautiously through several rooms
- Search an area thoroughly
- Force open a stuck door
- Pick a lock
- Rest and catch your breath

**Light matters.** Torches burn out. Lanterns need oil. If your light dies in the dark, you're in serious trouble.

**Rest matters.** After about an hour of exploration, you'll need to stop and rest or risk exhaustion.

## Time in the Wilderness

Overland, time is tracked in **Watches** (about 6 hours each). Four watches make a day.

A typical day:
- **Two watches of travel** — the safe maximum
- **One watch for camp** — hunting, foraging, setting up
- **One watch for sleep** — you need it

**Supplies matter.** Track your provisions. Running out in the wild is dangerous.

**Weather matters.** Storms slow travel. Extreme conditions can kill.

## What You Should Know

**The Referee controls the procedures.** They'll tell you when to roll, when danger approaches, and when resources are consumed. Your job is to describe what you're doing and make smart choices.

**Ask questions.** "What do we see?" "Is there another way around?" "How far is the noise?" Information keeps you alive.

**Manage your resources.** Light, food, water, rest — these aren't flavour, they're survival. Plan for them.

**Time has consequences.** The longer you spend in a dangerous place, the more likely something finds you. Move with purpose.

## The Takeaway

You don't need to know the exact mechanics. The Referee handles the dice and the procedures. What you need is awareness:

- Light runs out
- Supplies run out
- Wandering monsters exist
- Rest is necessary
- Time spent = risk accumulated

Play smart. Ask questions. Don't assume the dungeon is waiting for you.
