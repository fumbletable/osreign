# Cleric

Clerics channel divine power—whether from the gods, nature, or some higher force. You're a capable combatant who heals allies, smites enemies, and shapes your path through your chosen oath.

**HD:** 6 + CON, then 1d6 (avg 3) + CON per level
**Saves:** WIS, CHA
**Ability Boost:** +1 WIS
**Weapons / Armor:** See your Oath below.

---

## Spellcasting

- **Casting stat:** WIS
- **Save DC:** 8 + PB + WIS
- **Spell attack:** PB + WIS
- **Preparation:** After a rest, prepare spells equal to your **level + WIS**.
- **Casting:** Spend a slot of the spell's tier or higher. The slot is lost; the spell remains on your list.
- **Progression:** Clerics use the Spell Slot Progression table (see [Magic Overview](magic.md)).

---

## Boost Hook

When casting a spell marked **Boostable**, you may spend a **Boost Die** to trigger its extra effect (e.g., *Cure Light Wounds* heals an extra +1d4).

---

## Oaths

At 1st level, choose one oath. This shapes your path, spell list, and unique gifts.
