## Hallowed Oath (Sanctity)

- **Spell list:** Cleric (tiers 1–6).
- **Weapons:** Light, Medium (**bludgeoning only**).
- **Armor:** Light, Medium, Shields.
- **Unique Feature:** Gains **Turn Undead**.

**Turn Undead**
**Action:** Present holy symbol and call upon your power.
- Make a **Normal WIS check**.
- **On success:** affect `2d6 + PB` HD of undead within NEAR, starting with the lowest HD first.
  - If the undead's HD ≤ (your level − 3), it is **Destroyed**.
  - If the undead's HD ≤ (your level + 1), it is **Turned** for `2d6` rounds (must flee, cannot approach).
  - If its HD > (your level + 1), it is **unaffected**.
- **On failure:** no effect; you cannot attempt Turn Undead again this combat.

**Starting Kit:**
- Chain, Shield, Mace; Holy Symbol, Holy Water (1), Sling & 20 stones.

## Druidic Oath (Nature)

- **Spell list:** Druidic (tiers 1–6).
- **Weapons:** Sickles, Staves, Spears, Slings.
- **Armor:** Light, Wooden Shields.
- **Unique Feature:** Your path grants access to **Wild Shape**, but you do **not Turn Undead**.

**Wild Shape**
**Action:** Expend Hit Dice equal to a beast's Hit Dice to assume its form.
- **Form:** You may become any natural beast you have seen, provided you can pay its Hit Dice cost from your pool.
- **Duration:** **1d6 rounds.** After rolling, you may spend a **Boost Die** to add **+1d6 rounds.**
- **HP:** While shaped, your HP becomes the beast's full HP. When that HP is lost or the duration ends, you revert; any excess damage carries over.
- **Resource trade:** The Hit Dice spent are **gone from your pool until you rest in a Safe Haven.**
- **Traits gained:** The beast's movement, senses, and natural attacks. You cannot cast spells while shaped. Gear merges or drops (your choice).
- **Tone:** Every change taxes your body; too many shifts leave you unable to heal.

**Starting Kit:**
- Leather, Staff, Sickles, Sling; Herbalist's Kit, Holy Symbol.
