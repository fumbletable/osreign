# Economy

This page consolidates all economic information for OSwR - what things cost, what adventurers earn, and how gold flows through the game.

---

## Currency

**Standard:** 1 gold piece (gp) is the default unit.

| Coin | Value |
|------|-------|
| Copper (cp) | 1/100 gp |
| Silver (sp) | 1/10 gp |
| Gold (gp) | 1 gp |
| Platinum (pp) | 10 gp |

**Wages baseline:** 1 gp/day for unskilled labour. This anchors all other prices.

**Encumbrance:** 100 coins = 1 slot. Carrying wealth is a logistical problem.

---

## XP & Treasure

**1 XP per 1 GP** of treasure recovered from dangerous locations.

This is the primary advancement engine. See [Advancement](advancement.md) for full XP rules.

---

## Banking & Storage

Temples, guilds, and money-changers will store gold securely. Depositing is free. Withdrawing costs a fee.

| Institution | Withdrawal Fee | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Temple bank | 10% | Excellent security. Divine protection. |
| Guild bank | 10% | Good security. May require membership. |
| Money-changer | 10% | Also exchanges gems and foreign coin. |

**Long-term storage:** If gold is left for at least **one month**, withdrawal is **free**. This encourages adventurers to deposit and go adventuring rather than constantly dipping in.

**Loans:** Available at 10% interest per month. Loans over 5 gp require collateral worth twice the loan value.

**Hidden caches:** You can bury or hide treasure yourself. No fee, but the Referee may roll for discovery if enemies learn of it or significant time passes.

---

## Training Costs

Levelling grants capacity. Unlocking abilities costs gold and time.

| Training | Time | Cost |
|----------|------|------|
| Feat (any) | 1 week | 500 gp |
| Ability increase | — | Free |

---

## Magic-User Costs

**The 100 gp/day principle:** Arcane work costs 100 gp per day.

| Activity | Time | Cost |
|----------|------|------|
| Copy spell from source | 1 day/tier | 100 gp/tier |
| Learn from mentor | 1 day/tier | 100 gp/tier + quest |
| Research spell | 1 week/tier | 700 gp/week |
| Backup own spell | 1 hr/tier | 50 gp/tier |
| Spellbook (blank, 20 capacity) | — | 200 gp |

See [Spellbooks & Research](spellbooks-and-research.md) for full rules.

## Cleric Costs

Clerics don't use spellbooks - they receive spells through divine connection. But maintaining that connection requires ongoing sacrifice.

### Tithes (Required)

Clerics must give **10% of all treasure** to maintain divine favour. This is not optional - a Cleric who fails to tithe will find their spells no longer function until the debt is paid.

| Cleric Type | Tithe To | Form |
|-------------|----------|------|
| Hallowed | Temple | Donations to temple works, charity |
| Druidic | Nature | Offerings at sacred sites, releasing animals, sacrifices, community feasts |

**Hallowed Clerics** give to their temple institution. The gold supports the faith's works.

**Druidic Clerics** return wealth to nature. Gold is consumed, scattered, or given away - offerings at standing stones and sacred groves, releasing captive animals, burning goods as sacrifice, feasting the local community. The treasure goes *back* rather than to an institution.

### Pious Offerings (XP)

Clerics may give *beyond* their tithe to gain XP, as an alternative to carousing.

| Cleric Type | Where | Maximum |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Hallowed | Temple/Cathedral | Settlement limit |
| Druidic | Sacred site | Referee discretion |

Spend gold on offerings, gain equal XP. No mishap roll - the divine accepts your sacrifice.

**Settlement limits:** Village 100 gp, Town 500 gp, City 2,000 gp.

Non-Clerics may donate to temples, but don't gain XP - they're patrons, not faithful.

### Equipment

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Holy symbol (wooden) | 1 gp |
| Holy symbol (silver) | 25 gp |
| Holy symbol (gold) | 100 gp |
| Consecrated water (flask) | 25 gp |
| Prayer book / scriptures | 50 gp |
| Vestments (simple) | 10 gp |
| Vestments (ceremonial) | 100 gp |

---

## Temple Services

Temples offer healing and other services—for a price. Divine magic isn't free; these costs support the temple and its works.

| Service | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Cure minor wounds | 50 gp | Heal 1d8 HP |
| Cure serious wounds | 150 gp | Heal 2d8+2 HP |
| Cure disease | 500 gp | Removes one disease |
| Cure poison | 500 gp | Neutralises one poison |
| Remove curse | 1,000 gp | May require quest for powerful curses |
| Raise dead | 5,000 gp+ | If available at all. Rare. |
| Divination | 200-1,000 gp | Varies by complexity |

**Discounts:** Temples may reduce fees for faithful members, those who have done service, or adventurers pursuing the temple's goals.

**Unavailable:** Not all temples offer all services. Small village shrines may only provide basic healing. Raising the dead requires a major temple and a high-level priest—if the temple permits it at all.

---

## Hirelings & Retainers

| Type | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Unskilled hireling | 1 gp/day | Torchbearer, porter. Won't fight. |
| Skilled hireling | 2-5 gp/day | Craftsman, guide, healer. |
| Mercenary | 3-5 gp/day | Armed guard. Won't enter dungeons. |
| Retainer | 2-5 gp/day + half share | Adventuring companion. Shares risk. |

**Wergild:** 50 gp per level of the deceased retainer, paid to their kin if they die in service.
