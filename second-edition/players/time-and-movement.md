# Time and Movement

How long things take and how far you can go.

---

## Time Segments

| Segment | Duration | Use |
|---------|----------|-----|
| **Round** | 6 seconds | Combat actions |
| **Turn** | 10 minutes | Dungeon exploration |
| **Watch** | 6 hours | Wilderness travel, marching, or rest |
| **Day** | 24 hours | Downtime, recovery, overland travel |

---

## Movement

| Speed | Per Round | Per Turn (dungeon) | Per Watch (wilderness) |
|-------|----------:|-------------------:|------------------------:|
| **Slow** | 15 ft | 45 yards | 4.5 miles |
| **Normal** | 30 ft | 90 yards | 9 miles |
| **Fast** | 45 ft | 135 yards | 13.5 miles |

- **Slow:** Cautious, sneaking, or encumbered.
- **Normal:** Average travelling pace.
- **Fast:** Urgent or reckless movement.

**Turn speed** (dungeon) = 3× base speed in yards. Assumes cautious exploration — watching footing, checking for danger, mapping.

**Watch speed** (wilderness) = distance covered in 6 hours of marching with gear. See *Wilderness Exploration* for terrain modifiers.

## Light Sources

| Source | Duration | Radius |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Torch** | 6 Turns (1 hour) | 30 ft bright, 30 ft dim |
| **Lantern** | 6 hours (1 flask of oil) | 30 ft bright, 30 ft dim |
| **Candle** | 1 hour | 5 ft bright, 5 ft dim |

**Darkvision:** See 30 ft in dim light as if bright, darkness as dim. No colour, no fine detail.

**No light:** Effectively blind. SETBACK on all rolls. Movement halved.

## Ranges

| Range | Distance | Use |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **Close** | Within 5 ft | Melee striking distance, whisper |
| **Near** | Within 30 ft | All ranged weapons, normal voice |
| **Far** | 30–120 ft | Powerful ranged weapons, shout |
| **Very Far** | Beyond 120 ft | Out of striking range, often out of sight |

---

## Climbing, Swimming, Crawling

Movement is reduced by one step (Fast → Normal, Normal → Slow) unless the creature has a climbing or swimming speed.

- **Slippery or difficult surfaces:** STR check, DC set by conditions.
- **Rough water:** STR check to make progress.

---

## Jumping

**Long Jump:** 10 + STR feet (with 10 ft run-up). Standing long jump = half that.

**High Jump:** 3 + STR feet (with 10 ft run-up). Standing high jump = half that.

Difficult landings or obstacles may require a STR or DEX check.

---

## Falling

Take **1d6 cumulative damage** for every 10 ft fallen. Land prone.

- 10 ft = 1d6
- 20 ft = 1d6 + 2d6 = 3d6
- 30 ft = 1d6 + 2d6 + 3d6 = 6d6

---

## Suffocation

A creature can hold its breath for **1 + CON** minutes (minimum 30 seconds).

When out of breath, survive for **CON** rounds (minimum 1). At the start of the next turn after that, drop to 0 HP and begin dying. Cannot be stabilized until breathing again.
