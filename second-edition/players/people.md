# Species

Every character belongs to one of the four core species.
- All characters speak **Common** and their racial tongue (for Humans, only Common).
- **Bonus languages:** You gain a number of extra languages equal to your INT modifier (if it's above 0).
- Each species has 3 traits: one marked **Essential** (core to old-school play), two others can vary or swap for sub-races.
