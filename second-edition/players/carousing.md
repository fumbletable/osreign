# Carousing

Carousing lets adventurers convert gold directly into XP through nights of drinking, gambling, and revelry. It's a gold sink that rewards risk-taking and creates stories.

---

## The Rules

Spend a night drinking, gambling, and making merry in a settlement. Spend up to the settlement's maximum in gold. **Gain XP equal to gold spent.**

| Settlement | Maximum Spend |
|------------|---------------|
| Village | 100 gp |
| Town | 500 gp |
| City | 2,000 gp |

The next morning, make a **CON check (DC 12)**. On a failure, roll on the Mishap table.

You may carouse again the following night—if the mishaps haven't caught up with you.

## Mishaps (2d6)

| Roll | Result |
|-----:|--------|
| **2** | **Jailed.** You wake in a cell. Bail is 1d6 × 100 gp, or a favour for someone unsavoury. Your gear is impounded until you pay. |
| **3** | **Enemy made.** Someone powerful now hates you. A guild leader, noble's son, or criminal boss. They'll remember your face. |
| **4** | **Gambling debt.** You owe 1d6 × 50 gp to someone who doesn't accept "no." They have friends. Payment due within the week. |
| **5** | **Robbed.** Lose half your remaining coin. Your purse was cut, or you were rolled in an alley. No idea who did it. |
| **6** | **Fined.** Property damage, public indecency, or disturbing the peace. Pay 2d6 × 10 gp or spend a night in the stocks. |
| **7** | **Brutal hangover.** SETBACK on all checks until you complete a full rest. You remember nothing useful. |
| **8** | **Embarrassing tattoo.** It's prominent. It's ugly. It might be offensive to someone. Removal costs 100 gp and hurts. |
| **9** | **Entangled.** You promised something. A favour, a job, your sword arm. Someone will collect. Work out the details with the Referee. |
| **10** | **Reputation shift.** Word spreads about your antics. +1 to reaction rolls with rogues and lowlifes. −1 with respectable folk. Lasts until you do something to change it. |
| **11** | **New contact.** You hit it off with someone useful—a fence, smuggler, off-duty guard, or guild member. They owe you a small favour, or you owe them one. |
| **12** | **Windfall.** You won big, found something, or someone owes YOU. Gain 1d6 × 50 gp, a rumour leading to treasure, or a minor magic item (Referee's choice). |

## Design Notes

**Why carousing?** It solves two problems:

1. **Gold accumulation.** Without spending, treasure piles up meaninglessly. Carousing gives it somewhere to go.

2. **Uneven party advancement.** If a Fighter carouses while the Magic-User saves for spell research, the Fighter levels faster—but becomes a better bodyguard for the squishy wizard. Everyone benefits.

**The mishap table creates stories.** The most common result (7) is just a hangover. But the extremes—jail, enemies, windfalls—become campaign moments.

**Limits by settlement size.** You can only spend what the local economy can absorb. A village tavern can't handle 2,000 gp of revelry. This also encourages returning to larger towns.
