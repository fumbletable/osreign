# Rests & Recovery

### Breather (10 minutes) — choose ONE
- **Heal:** Spend 1 Provision, regain `1d4 + CON` HP.
- **Clear Winded:** Spend 1 Provision and roll CON 12 (EDGE if gear/plan helps).

You cannot combine these in the same Breather.

**Rally Breather (exception):**
If someone dropped to 0 HP this fight, during the next Breather that hero may both **Heal** and **Clear Winded** if an adjacent ally spends **1 Provision** on them or the hero spends **2 Provisions**.

---

### Night's Rest (8 hours)
- Spend Hit Dice to heal.
- Regain all spell slots; you may change prepared spells.
- Fatigue: remove 2 if you had food and shelter; otherwise remove 1.

---

### Safe Haven (1d4+1 days)
- **Full reset:** all HP, spell slots, and Fatigue restored.
- **Injuries:** Minor clear automatically; Major require treatment or magic (Referee's call).
