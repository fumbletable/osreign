# Feats

Feats let you customize your character beyond class and background. They're how you build archetypes - a Ranger emerges from an Expert with wilderness feats, a Paladin from a Fighter with divine feats.

- [General Feats](general-feats.md) — Available to all characters at even levels
- [Fighter Feats](fighter-feats.md) — Combat specializations for Fighters
- [Expert Feats](expert-feats.md) — Skills and tricks for Experts (who can also pick from General)
