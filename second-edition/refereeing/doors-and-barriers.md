# Doors & Barriers

Barriers slow exploration and create noise. Each attempt costs at least **1 Turn** (10 minutes).

---

## Stuck Doors
- Require a STR save (Normal 12).
- On fail: door holds but time is lost.
- On success: door opens with a crash — roll an extra Encounter check.
- A second attempt may be made, but always makes noise.

---

## Locked Doors
- Require **Thieves' Tools** and a DEX save (Normal 12).
- Fail = lock jammed; further attempts at SETBACK.
- Without tools: STR save (Hard 16) to break the lock (always noisy).

---

## Secret Doors
- Only found if **searched** (WIS save, Normal 12).
- Elves (and some builds/feats) may sense them automatically when within 5 ft (Referee rolls secretly).
- Secret doors usually open with hidden levers, rotating panels, or counterweights; solving may take multiple Turns.

---

## Breaking Objects
- **Wooden Barriers (furniture, crates):** STR save (Normal 12).
- **Iron Bars, Stone Walls:** normally require tools, acid, or magic.
- **Crowbars/Tools:** grant EDGE to breaking attempts.

---

## Noise & Risk
- Smashing, prying, or forcing doors = **automatic noise**.
- Referee may call for an immediate Encounter roll.
- Clever players (oil hinges, padding strikes, prying slowly) may mitigate risk.

---

## Notes
- **Every failed attempt eats time** → burning light and provisions.
- **Every noisy success increases danger** → risk of wandering monsters.
