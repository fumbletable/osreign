# Doors & Barriers

Barriers create tension: time lost, noise made, resources burned. Every attempt costs **1 Turn**.

---

## Stuck Doors

Stuck doors are the dungeon fighting back. They exist to cost time, make noise, and force decisions.

A stuck door requires a **STR check (DC 12)** to force open.

- **Fail:** The door holds. Time is lost. They can try again.
- **Success:** The door crashes open — roll the hazard die immediately.

**Tools help.** A crowbar or pry bar grants **Edge**. Multiple characters pushing together can grant **Edge** at your discretion.

Forcing a door is never quiet. Even a failed attempt makes noise.

## Locked Doors

Picking a lock requires **Thieves' Tools** and a **DEX check (DC 12)**.

- **Fail:** The lock is jammed. These tools won't open it — they need another way in or must break it down.
- **Success:** The lock clicks open quietly.

**Pick Locks feat:** Characters with this Expert feat open non-magical locks automatically — no check required.

**No tools?** They'll have to break down the door instead (see Stuck Doors).

**Clever solutions:** If players describe removing hinges, pouring acid on the lock, or prying the frame — adjudicate whether it would work. Most doors have hinges on the inside, but not all.

## Secret Doors

**Targeted search:** If players search the right area ("I check the bookcase for hidden latches"), they find the door. No roll needed — reward the clever play.

**Room search:** If they search the whole room without a specific spot, call for a **WIS check (DC 12-16)** based on how well-hidden it is. This takes 1 Turn.

**Finding a secret door doesn't mean knowing how to open it.** The mechanism itself is the puzzle: hidden levers, pressure plates, rotating panels, counterweights. Solving it may take multiple Turns of experimentation.

**Elves and Dwarves:** Their ancestry traits (Secret Door Sense, Stone Sense) let you roll a secret check when they pass within 5 ft of hidden features. This is a bonus clue, not a substitute for player engagement.

## Noise

Smashing, prying, or forcing anything makes noise. When this happens:

- **Creatures nearby** hear it and react — enemies in the next room come to investigate
- **No one close?** Roll the hazard die to see if something further away takes notice

Clever players may mitigate risk — oiling hinges, padding strikes, prying slowly. Reward this with quieter outcomes, but don't let caution eliminate all tension.

---

## The Pressure

Every barrier costs something:

- **Time** — Turns spent mean torches burning, the hazard die rolling
- **Noise** — Forcing things alerts the dungeon
- **Resources** — Failed attempts still consume the Turn

This is the loop: barriers slow progress, slowing progress burns resources, burning resources raises stakes.
