# Designer Commentary

This page explains the thinking behind OSwR's design decisions. It's here for playtesters and curious readers who want to understand *why* the rules work the way they do.

---

## The Core Vision

**"5e chassis, OSR soul."**

OSwR takes the mechanical foundation that modern players know (bounded accuracy, proficiency bonus, advantage/disadvantage) and pairs it with the play philosophy that makes old-school games sing (player skill over character builds, resource pressure, emergent narrative).

The goal: a game where 5e players feel mechanically at home but discover a completely different play experience.

---

## Why Four Classes?

Classic D&D had fighters, magic-users, clerics, and thieves. OSwR has Fighter, Magic-User, Cleric, and Expert.

**Why not more?** Every additional class creates overlap, edge cases, and balance concerns. Four classes can cover any character concept when combined with backgrounds, feats, and multiclassing.

**Why "Expert" instead of "Thief"?** Thief implies criminality. Expert implies competence. A scout, diplomat, or artisan is an Expert. So is a thief. The name doesn't constrain the fiction.

---

## Why Feats Cost Gold?

In 5e, you level up and get your features automatically. In OSwR, levelling grants the *capacity* for new abilities - you must still pay gold and spend time to unlock them.

**The reasoning:**

1. **Gold sinks matter.** Without ways to spend treasure, gold piles up pointlessly. Training costs keep gold valuable at every level.

2. **Fiction follows.** Your Fighter didn't just wake up knowing Shield Master. They spent a week drilling, bought practice equipment, maybe hired a sparring partner. The gold represents that.

3. **Different classes, different pressures.** Magic-Users spend gold on spell research. Fighters spend it on feats. The system naturally creates different economic priorities without forcing it.

4. **Party dynamics.** A Fighter who carouses (spending gold for XP) might level faster than a Magic-User saving for research. That's fine - the Fighter becomes a better bodyguard for the squishy wizard. Everyone benefits.

---

## Why 1 GP = 1 XP?

This is the classic OSR ratio, and it's not arbitrary.

**Emergent gameplay.** When treasure is the primary XP source, players pursue treasure. They sneak past the dragon because fighting is risky and the hoard is what matters. They negotiate with goblins because dead goblins don't lead to treasure rooms. The *system* rewards clever play - the Referee doesn't have to decide what counts as "clever."

**Player-driven.** With milestone or story XP, the Referee controls advancement. With treasure XP, the players control it. Find more treasure, level faster. The world contains the rewards; players decide how to get them.

**Module compatibility.** Decades of published adventures have treasure placed assuming 1 GP = 1 XP. OSwR can use those adventures unchanged.

---

## Why Monster XP = HD² × 10?

This creates a smooth curve where tougher monsters are worth significantly more, but treasure remains the primary XP source.

| HD | XP |
|---:|---:|
| 1 | 10 |
| 3 | 90 |
| 5 | 250 |
| 10 | 1,000 |

A goblin (HD 1) is worth 10 XP. A dragon (HD 10) is worth 1,000 XP. But the dragon's *hoard* might be worth 10,000+ XP. The maths reinforce the play philosophy: treasure matters more than kills.

---

## Why Research Is Expensive?

Spell research costs 700 gp per week and requires an INT check. Failed weeks lose time AND half the gold. This is intentionally harsh.

**The world is the better deal.** Finding a scroll in a dungeon costs only the copying fee (100 gp/tier). Research is the fallback when you can't find what you need. This encourages exploration and rewards player resourcefulness.

**Magic-Users are powerful.** By tier 5-6, spells reshape reality. That power should be earned through adventure, not bought in a library. Research exists so wizards always have a path forward - but it shouldn't be the easy path.

---

## Why Carousing?

Carousing lets players convert gold directly to XP by spending it on revelry. This solves several problems:

1. **Gold accumulation.** Without spending, treasure becomes meaningless numbers. Carousing gives it somewhere to go.

2. **Different advancement strategies.** A Fighter who carouses and a Magic-User who saves for research will level at different rates. This is intentional - it creates party dynamics.

3. **Story generation.** The mishap table creates situations. Gambling debts, new enemies, embarrassing tattoos, unexpected windfalls. Carousing turns downtime into adventure hooks.

---

## Why Cleric Tithes?

Magic-Users pay for every spell - 100 gp to copy, 700+ gp to research. Clerics receive their spells through divine connection. Without an equivalent cost, Clerics would have a massive economic advantage.

**The solution:** Clerics must tithe 10% of all treasure to maintain divine favour. This creates a gold sink that scales with success and fits the fiction of divine service.

**Hallowed vs Druidic:** Hallowed Clerics give to their temple. Druidic Clerics return wealth to nature - offerings at sacred sites, releasing animals, burning sacrifices, feasting communities. Same mechanical effect, different fiction.

---

## Why "Overcome" Instead of "Kill"?

Monster XP is earned when you "overcome" a threat - which includes defeating, outsmarting, driving off, or otherwise neutralising it.

**Combat is not the only solution.** Tricking the ogre into leaving, negotiating safe passage with the bandits, or locking the gelatinous cube in a room all count as overcoming the threat. The XP reward is the same.

**This matches the play philosophy.** If we only rewarded kills, players would fight everything. But OSwR wants players to think, negotiate, and avoid unnecessary risks. The XP rules support that.

---

## On Bounded Accuracy

OSwR uses the 5e principle of bounded accuracy: numbers stay small, bonuses don't inflate wildly with level, and a +1 always matters.

**Why keep it?** It works. Low-level threats remain relevant. High-level characters are powerful but not invincible. The maths are simple and the probability curves are intuitive.

**The trade-off:** Characters don't feel superheroic at high levels the way they do in 5e. That's intentional. OSwR is about dangerous adventures, not power fantasies.

---

## On The Four Tiers

OSwR roughly divides play into tiers:

| Tier | Levels | Play Style |
|------|--------|------------|
| Novice | 1-3 | Fragile, local, learning the world |
| Journeyman | 4-6 | Competent, regional, taking on serious threats |
| Veteran | 7-9 | Powerful, famous, shaping events |
| Name Level | 10-12 | Domain play, legacy, shaping the world |

This isn't explicit in the rules, but it's implicit in the pacing and costs. The game shifts as characters grow - from "survive the dungeon" to "what kind of lord will you be?"

---

## What's Still Being Figured Out

**Treasure tables.** We have the XP ratios but not the generation tables. How much treasure per room? Per dungeon level? This needs playtesting.

**Domain play.** Stronghold costs, army management, domain income. The bones are there; the flesh isn't.

---

## Feedback Welcome

This is an alpha. Things will change. If something doesn't work at your table, I want to know.

The goal is a game that delivers on its promise: the mechanical familiarity of 5e with the emergent, player-driven adventure of old-school play.
