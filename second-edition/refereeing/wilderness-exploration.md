# Wilderness Exploration

The wilderness is tracked in **Watches** (6 hours). Four watches make a day.

> **Watch Procedure**
> 1. Party declares activity (travel, hunt, forage, investigate, rest)
> 2. Navigator rolls if travelling through unclear terrain
> 3. Resolve the activity
> 4. Roll hazard die (if travelling or night watch)
> 5. Mark time; check provisions if needed

## The Day

| Watch | Typical Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **Dawn** | Break camp, travel |
| **Midday** | Travel, forage, hunt |
| **Dusk** | Make camp, rest activities |
| **Night** | Sleep, keep watch |

A party can **travel for two watches** per day without difficulty. Pushing beyond this is gruelling — the GM decides the consequences.

**Sleep:** Characters need at least one watch of sleep. Missing sleep requires a CON save (DC 12) or gain 1 Fatigue. The DC increases by 3 for each consecutive day without proper rest.

---

## Travel Pace

| Pace | Distance per Watch | Daily (2 watches) | Notes |
|------|-------------------:|------------------:|-------|
| **Slow** | ~4.5 miles | ~9 miles | Can forage while travelling. EDGE on navigation. |
| **Normal** | ~9 miles | ~18 miles | Standard pace. |
| **Fast** | ~13.5 miles | ~27 miles | No foraging. Exhausting — GM may impose consequences. |

**Hex scale:** At Normal pace, a party crosses three 6-mile hexes per day, or three 36-mile hexes per week (travelling 6 days, resting 1).

**Mounts:** Double travel distance, but require fodder (1 provision per mount per day).

**Terrain:** The GM adjusts pace based on conditions. Roads and rivers speed travel. Mountains, dense forest, and swamps slow it. A clear road might allow 50% more distance; a trackless swamp might halve it.

---

## Navigation

When the path is unclear, the navigator makes a **WIS check** each watch.

- **Clear route** (road, river, obvious landmarks): No roll needed.
- **Unclear terrain:** DC set by GM based on difficulty. Forest with game trails might be DC 10. Featureless desert DC 16.

**Pace affects navigation:**
- Slow pace = EDGE on the check
- Fast pace = SETBACK on the check

**Getting Lost:** On a failure, the party veers off course. The GM rolls secretly to determine which direction they drift. They won't realise they're lost until landmarks don't match expectations or a successful check reveals the error.

---

## Foraging

A character can forage during travel at Slow pace, or dedicate a watch to foraging while stationary.

**WIS check** - DC set by GM based on terrain and season. A bountiful forest in summer might be DC 8. A sparse hillside in winter DC 14.

- **Success:** Find 1d4 provisions.
- **Beat DC by 3+:** Find an additional 1d4 provisions.
- **Fail:** Nothing found.

---

## Hunting

Hunting takes a **full watch** and cannot be done while travelling.

**Step 1 - Locate Prey:** WIS check. DC set by GM based on terrain and game availability.
- Success = prey found.
- Determine prey size: **1d6 provisions, +1d6 for every 3 points you beat the DC.**

**Step 2 - Kill:** Make an attack roll against a DC set by the GM (typically DC 12, harder for dangerous or wary prey).
- **Success:** Harvest the provisions.
- **Fail:** Prey escapes. May try again next watch.

*A skilled hunter in good territory can bring back a serious haul. A failed hunt costs precious time with nothing to show for it.*

---

## Making Camp

At the end of a travel day, one character can search for a good campsite.

**WIS check (DC 12):**
- **Success:** Defensible site found. Night encounter rolls made with SETBACK (GM rolls the hazard die with a d6 penalty).
- **Fail:** Exposed or poor site. Normal encounter chances. +1 to be surprised if encounter occurs.

**Interrupted rest** (encounter, severe weather) may require a CON save (DC 12) or gain 1 Fatigue.

---

## The Hazard Die

Roll **1d6** once per watch travelled, and once each night.

| Roll | Result |
|-----:|--------|
| 1 | **Encounter** — something appears. Roll or choose from your encounter table. |
| 2 | **Sign** — tracks, spoor, distant smoke, old campfire, omen. Hints at what's nearby. |
| 3 | **Weather** — conditions shift. Storm rolls in, fog descends, temperature drops. |
| 4 | **Provisions** — spoilage, pests, dropped pack, torn sack. Lose 1d4 provisions. |
| 5–6 | **Nothing** — the journey continues uneventfully. |

**At night:** Encounters arrive at camp. Signs are heard, not seen — sounds in the darkness, eyes reflecting firelight, howls in the distance.

---

## Weather

When the hazard die shows Weather, or when you need to set conditions, roll 2d6:

| 2d6 | Weather |
|----:|---------|
| 2 | **Severe** — storm, blizzard, or extreme heat. Travel halted or dangerous. |
| 3–4 | **Poor** — heavy rain, strong winds, or bitter cold. Pace slowed. |
| 5–9 | **Fair** — typical for the season. No effect. |
| 10–11 | **Good** — clear skies, mild temperature. Pleasant travel. |
| 12 | **Perfect** — ideal conditions. EDGE on navigation. |

Adjust the table for region and season — a desert's "severe" is sandstorm or scorching heat; a mountain's is blizzard or freezing fog.

**Extreme weather** may require CON saves (DC 12) to avoid Fatigue. Proper gear, shelter, or magic grants EDGE on the save.

---

## Investigate

Spend a watch exploring the current hex thoroughly rather than passing through.

**WIS check** — DC set by GM based on how well-hidden features are.
- **Success:** The GM reveals hidden features — ruins, lairs, resources, hazards, or points of interest that wouldn't be noticed while travelling.
- **Fail:** Nothing found, but the watch is spent.

*Some hexes have nothing to find. Others reward careful exploration.*

## Quick Reference

| Activity | Time | Check |
|----------|------|-------|
| Travel (max 2/day) | 1 watch each | — |
| Navigate | Per watch | WIS vs terrain |
| Forage | While slow, or 1 watch | WIS vs terrain |
| Hunt | 1 watch | WIS to locate, attack to kill |
| Investigate | 1 watch | WIS vs hidden |
| Find campsite | End of day | WIS (Normal) |
| Sleep | 1 watch minimum | — |

**Hazard Die:** Roll each watch travelled + once at night.
