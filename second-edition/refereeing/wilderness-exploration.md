# Wilderness Exploration

The wilderness is tracked in **Watches** (4 hours). Six watches make a day.

> **Watch Procedure**
> 1. Party declares activity (travel, hunt, forage, investigate, rest)
> 2. Navigator rolls if traveling through difficult terrain
> 3. Roll hazard die when entering a new or unexplored hex
> 4. Resolve the activity (Referee decides when hazard occurs)
> 5. Mark time; check Supply at end of day

## The Day

| Watch | Time | Typical Use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Dawn** | 6am–10am | Break camp, travel |
| **Midday** | 10am–2pm | Travel, activities |
| **Afternoon** | 2pm–6pm | Travel, activities |
| **Evening** | 6pm–10pm | Make camp, eat |
| **Night 1** | 10pm–2am | Rest, keep lookout |
| **Night 2** | 2am–6am | Rest, keep lookout |

**Travel:** A party can travel for **three watches** per day without difficulty. A fourth watch of travel is a forced march — make a CON save, Normal (DC 12) each hour or gain 1 Fatigue.

**Rest:** Characters need **two watches of rest** per day. Someone must keep lookout, but characters can rotate. Missing a night's rest means no rest benefits and requires a CON save, Normal (DC 12) or gain 1 Fatigue. The DC increases by 3 for each consecutive day without proper rest.

**Supply:** Each character consumes **1 Supply per day**. If water is hard to find (desert, arctic), consume **2 Supply per day** to account for carried water.

## Terrain

Terrain determines travel speed and activity difficulty.

| Terrain | Speed | Navigation | Hunt | Forage |
|---------|:-----:|:----------:|:----:|:------:|
| **Road, clear trail** | Fast | — | — | — |
| **Coast** | Normal | Easy | Normal | Easy |
| **Grassland, plains** | Normal | Normal | Easy | Easy |
| **Hills** | Normal | Normal | Normal | Normal |
| **Forest** | Slow | Hard | Easy | Easy |
| **Mountains** | Slow | Normal | Hard | Hard |
| **Swamp** | Slow | Hard | Normal | Normal |
| **Desert** | Slow | Normal | Hard | Hard |
| **Arctic** | Slow | Normal | Hard | Hard |

*Easy = DC 8, Normal = DC 12, Hard = DC 16. "—" means no roll needed or not applicable.*

*These are guidelines. Season and conditions can shift difficulty — a forest in winter might be Hard to forage instead of Easy. Use your judgment.*

**Travel speeds:**
- **Fast:** 9 miles per watch (1.5 hexes)
- **Normal:** 6 miles per watch (1 hex)
- **Slow:** 3 miles per watch (half hex)

**Hex scale:** At Normal speed, a party crosses one 6-mile hex per watch, three hexes per day.

**Mounts:** Mounts help on open terrain — roads, plains, grassland. They move one speed category faster in suitable terrain. In swamp, dense forest, or mountains, mounts provide no benefit and may be a liability. Mounts require 1 Supply per day.

---

## Navigation

When traveling through difficult terrain, the navigator makes a **WIS check** each watch. DC set by terrain table.

- **Road or clear landmarks:** No roll needed.

**Getting Lost:** On a failure, the party veers off course. The Referee rolls 1d6 secretly:
- **1–2:** Drift left
- **3–4:** Drift right
- **5–6:** Backtrack (no progress)

They won't realize they're lost until landmarks don't match expectations or a later successful check reveals the error.

## Activities

### Travel

Each watch of travel, the party covers distance based on terrain speed. Mark hexes crossed.

### Hunt (2 watches)

Hunting takes **two watches** and cannot be done while traveling.

1. **Locate Prey:** WIS check vs terrain DC.
   - Prey size: **1d6 Supply, +1d6 for every 3 points you beat the DC.**
2. **Kill:** Attack roll vs Normal (DC 12).
   - Success = harvest the Supply.
   - Fail = prey escapes. Can try again next watch.

### Forage (1 watch)

Spend a watch foraging. **WIS check** vs terrain DC.

- **Success:** Find 1d4 Supply.
- **Beat DC by 3+:** Find an additional 1d4 Supply.
- **Fail:** Nothing found.

### Investigate (1 watch)

Spend a watch thoroughly exploring the current hex. The Referee reveals any hidden features — ruins, lairs, resources, hazards, or points of interest that wouldn't be noticed while traveling.

*Some hexes have nothing to find. Others reward careful exploration.*

### Make Camp

At the end of a travel day, one character can search for a good campsite.

**WIS check, Normal (DC 12):**
- **Success:** Defensible site found. **Edge** on lookout checks during the night.
- **Fail:** Exposed site. Normal lookout checks.

### Rest

Characters need **two watches of rest** per day. Someone must keep lookout during the night watches — characters can rotate.

**Interrupted rest** (encounter, severe weather) may require a CON save, Normal (DC 12) or gain 1 Fatigue.

## The Hazard Die

The Referee rolls **1d6** when the situation warrants — generally when entering unexplored hexes, and once during the night watches. Roll more often in dangerous territory, less on safe roads. Use your judgment.

| Roll | Result |
|-----:|--------|
| 1 | **Encounter** — roll or choose from your encounter table. |
| 2 | **Sign** — tracks, spoor, distant smoke, sounds. Hints at what's nearby. |
| 3 | **Weather** — conditions shift. Roll on weather table or choose. |
| 4 | **Fatigue** — the journey wears. Consume 1 Supply, or make a CON save, Normal (DC 12) — fail and gain 1 Fatigue. |
| 5–6 | **Clear** — the watch passes uneventfully. |

---

## Weather

When you need weather, roll 2d6:

| 2d6 | Weather |
|----:|---------|
| 2 | **Severe** — storm, blizzard, extreme heat. Travel halted or dangerous. |
| 3–4 | **Poor** — heavy rain, strong winds, bitter cold. Travel one speed slower. |
| 5–9 | **Fair** — typical for the season. No effect. |
| 10–11 | **Good** — clear skies, mild temperature. Pleasant travel. |
| 12 | **Perfect** — ideal conditions. **Edge** on navigation. |

**Poor weather** slows travel by one speed category (Fast becomes Normal, Normal becomes Slow, Slow becomes half speed).

**Severe weather** may halt travel entirely or require CON saves, Normal (DC 12) to avoid Fatigue. Proper gear or shelter grants **Edge**.

## Quick Reference

| Activity | Time | Check |
|----------|------|-------|
| Travel | 1 watch | — |
| Navigate | Per watch (difficult terrain) | WIS vs terrain |
| Hunt | 2 watches | WIS + attack vs terrain |
| Forage | 1 watch | WIS vs terrain |
| Investigate | 1 watch | — (automatic) |
| Make camp | End of day | WIS, Normal (DC 12) |
| Rest | 2 watches | — |

**Daily limits:** Travel 3 watches. Rest 2 watches. Forced march = CON save each hour.

**Supply:** 1 per day (2 if water scarce).

**Hex scale:** Normal terrain = 6 miles/watch = 1 hex. Three hexes per day.

**Hazard die:** Generally roll when entering unexplored hexes + once at night.
