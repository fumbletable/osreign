# Generators

These d66 tables combine to create items, NPCs, and more. Roll on multiple tables and combine the results - the same combination means different things depending on context.

**The philosophy:** "A sword" and "a guard" are forgettable. "A notched iron blade with a wolf etched into the pommel" and "a nervous guard with flour on his boots" create questions. These tables help you create the second kind.

## The d66 System

Roll two six-sided dice. The first die picks the row (1-6), the second picks the column (1-6). A roll of 3,5 means row 3, column 5.

Every table uses this format. Once you learn it, generation takes seconds.

## Formula Combinations

Each generator includes **formulas** - explicit instructions for combining tables. This solves the problem many random tables leave implicit: *how do I use these together?*

**Example item formula:** Quality + Material + Form
- Roll Quality: 3,4 = Jeweled
- Roll Material: 1,2 = Iron
- Roll Form: 1,1 = Sword
- Result: Jeweled Iron Sword

**Example NPC formula:** Appearance + Demeanor + Occupation
- Roll Appearance: 1,1 = Scarred
- Roll Demeanor: 2,3 = Gregarious
- Roll Occupation: 4,2 = Soldier
- Result: A scarred, friendly soldier

The formulas range from quick (2-3 tables) to full (5-6 tables). Pick the depth you need.

## Context Determines Meaning

The same combination means different things based on where it's found:

**"Ancient Iron Ring"**
- Found in a peasant's pocket: A family heirloom, worth 5gp sentimentally
- Found in a dragon's hoard: Minor magic - the ring grants its wearer the dragon's ancient language
- Found on a lich's finger: Major artifact - binding the wearer to serve whoever placed it

The tables generate combinations. You interpret them.

## Design Notes

These generators follow principles from Maze Rats and Knave:

1. **d66 tables** - 36 entries each, easy to read, enough variety
2. **Explicit formulas** - Don't make referees figure out combinations
3. **Modular tables** - Roll only what you need
4. **Context over mechanics** - Same result, different meanings
5. **Questions over answers** - Every result should prompt "why?"

The tables grow with use. Add entries that fit your world, remove ones that don't.
