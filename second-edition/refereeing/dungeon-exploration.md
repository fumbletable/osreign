# Dungeon Exploration

Dungeons are tracked in **Turns** (10 minutes). Each Turn, the Referee notes light use, movement, and any chance of danger.

> **Turn Procedure**
> 1. Party declares marching order and actions
> 2. Referee describes what they see or encounter
> 3. Roll the hazard die
> 4. Resolve actions (Referee decides when hazard occurs)
> 5. Mark time; track light sources

## Movement

In a Turn (10 minutes), a character can move **3× their base speed** in yards while exploring cautiously — checking footing, watching for danger, mapping.

| Speed | Per Round | Per Turn (cautious) | Per Turn (rushing) |
|-------|----------:|--------------------:|-------------------:|
| **Slow** | 15 ft | 45 yards | 90 yards |
| **Normal** | 30 ft | 90 yards | 180 yards |
| **Fast** | 45 ft | 135 yards | 270 yards |

**Rushing:** Double movement, but no searching or mapping. SETBACK on checks to spot traps or hidden features.

## Light

Light is precious underground. Track it.

| Source | Duration | Radius |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Torch** | 6 Turns (1 hour) | 30 ft bright, 30 ft dim |
| **Lantern** | 6 hours (1 flask of oil) | 30 ft bright, 30 ft dim |
| **Candle** | 1 hour | 5 ft bright, 5 ft dim |

**Darkvision:** See 30 ft in dim light as if bright, darkness as dim. No color, no fine detail.

**No light:** Effectively blind. SETBACK on all rolls. Movement halved. Can't read, search, or spot danger.

## The Hazard Die

Roll **1d6 each Turn**:

| Roll | Result |
|-----:|--------|
| 1 | **Encounter** — a wandering monster appears. |
| 2 | **Sign** — noise, smell, tracks, or shadow hinting at nearby danger. |
| 3 | **Light** — a torch sputters out, or lantern oil runs low. |
| 4 | **Fatigue** — rest now for 10 minutes, or make a CON save (DC 12). Fail the save and gain 1 Fatigue. |
| 5–6 | **Nothing** — the turn passes uneventfully. |

**Use common sense.** If a torch just got lit, a result of 3 might mean it flickers ominously rather than dying. The hazard die creates pressure; it's not a straitjacket.

*Prefer traditional bookkeeping?* Roll a dice of your choice every Turn; on a 1, encounter. Track light (torch = 6 Turns, lantern = 1 Watch) and rest (once per hour) separately.

---

## Searching

Searching a room, passage, or feature for traps, hidden compartments, or secret doors takes **1 Turn**.

**WIS check** — DC set by how well-hidden the feature is. Easy (DC 8) for a loose flagstone; Hard (DC 16) for a master-crafted hidden door.

- **Success:** The Referee reveals what's there.
- **Fail:** Nothing found — but that doesn't mean nothing exists.

**Targeted searching** (examining a specific statue, chest, or section of wall) may take less time at the Referee's discretion.

---

## Surprise

When either side might be caught off guard:

**WIS check (DC 12)** for each character to avoid surprise.

- **Surprised:** Cannot act in the first round of combat.
- **Partial surprise:** Some party members may be surprised while others aren't.

Circumstances grant EDGE or SETBACK — a party creeping through darkness might surprise a distracted foe; a party arguing loudly won't surprise anyone.

---

## Fatigue & Rest

After **6 Turns** (~1 hour) of exploration, the party should rest for 1 Turn.

Skipping rest → each character makes a **CON save (DC 12)** or gains 1 Fatigue.

Rest means sitting, eating, drinking, catching breath — not moving or doing anything strenuous.
