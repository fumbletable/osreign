# Reaction Rolls

When you meet NPCs or monsters, don't assume they attack.
The Referee rolls **2d6**, modified by the party's highest **CHA**, to set their initial stance:

| Roll | Initial Reaction |
|-----:|------------------|
| 2 | Immediate attack (no chance to negotiate) |
| 3–5 | Hostile / unfriendly |
| 6–8 | Uncertain / cautious |
| 9–11 | Friendly / open |
| 12 | Immediate aid |

## Shifting the Reaction

After the initial roll (except on a 2), the party's spokesperson may try to shift the stance with a **CHA check** (Referee sets the DC based on context).

- **Success:** move the stance one step more favorable.
- **Nat 20:** move two steps more favorable.
- **Failure:** no change.
- **Nat 1:** move two steps less favorable.

This system makes first contact unpredictable, but still gives the party face a chance to steer outcomes through roleplay and CHA.
