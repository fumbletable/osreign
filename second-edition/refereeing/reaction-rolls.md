# Reaction Rolls

Not everything wants to fight. Reaction rolls let the world surprise you — and your players.

---

## Why This Matters

Don't pre-script NPC behaviour. A goblin patrol might be lost, hungry, or fleeing something worse. Bandits might want to negotiate. Even a troll might pause if offered food.

The reaction roll creates emergent encounters. You discover what happens alongside your players, and that's part of the fun.

## When to Roll

Roll when the party encounters creatures whose intentions aren't already established. Don't roll for mindless creatures, sworn enemies, or when the party attacks first.

## The Roll

Roll **2d6**:

| Roll | Reaction |
|-----:|----------|
| 2 | Hostile — attacks immediately |
| 3–5 | Unfriendly — threatens or demands |
| 6–8 | Uncertain — wary, waiting |
| 9–11 | Friendly — willing to talk |
| 12 | Helpful — offers aid |

Adjust for context: weapons drawn, reputation, gifts offered, what the creatures are protecting. A +1 or −1 either way is usually enough.

## After the Roll

The result is a starting point. Good roleplay can shift it — if what the party says or offers makes sense, move the reaction one step without a roll. If it's a hard sell, call for a CHA check.

## Retainers

Hiring retainers uses a similar 2d6 reaction roll. See [Retainers](retainers.md) for details.
