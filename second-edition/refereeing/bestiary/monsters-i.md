# Monsters I

---

## Insect Swarm
**HD 2-4 | AC immune to weapons | HP HD×4**<br>
Atk swarm (d3, double vs unarmored) | Mv Slow, Fly Slow | Ml 11 | XP varies<br>
Fills 3 10-ft cubes. Affected by Sleep. Smoke drives them away. Fire deals d4/round. Engulf: creatures inside the swarm take damage automatically—no attack roll.<br>
Wasps, locusts, biting flies—whatever it is, you hear it before you see it.

## Invisible Stalker
**HD 8 | AC 16 | HP 32** | Invisible<br>
Atk slam (4d4) | Mv Fast, Fly Fast | Ml 12 | XP 640<br>
Summoned by magic to fulfill a single command. Resents long tasks.<br>
Invisible, relentless, patient. Cannot be bargained with until the task is done.

## Ironbane
**HD 3 | AC 15 | HP 12** | Darkvision<br>
Atk touch (rust) | Mv Fast | Ml 8 | XP 90<br>
Touch transforms metal to rust. Non-magic metal ruined instantly. Magic items lose one "plus" per touch. Smells metal—drawn to armored prey.<br>
Armadillo-like creature with anteater snout. Silver and copper are candy to it.
