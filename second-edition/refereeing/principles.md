# Referee Principles

*These are our principles. The ultimate rule is simpler: if you're enjoying it and your players are enjoying it, you're doing it right.*

---

**Be the world.** You're not for the players or against them. You're the environment, the NPCs, the consequences. React honestly to what they do.

**Prep locations, situations, motivations.** That's all you need. Where things happen, what's going on there, and what the NPCs want. The players provide the action.

**Don't have a plot.** If you're protecting an NPC because you have plans for them, you've stopped being the world and started being an author. Let things play out.

**Let the world surprise you.** Use random tables - encounters, reactions, what they're doing. Discovering the world alongside your players is part of the fun.

**Telegraph danger.** The more dangerous something is, the more obvious it should be. Eight armored foes in formation tells players everything they need to know.

**Reward clever play.** When players think their way around a problem, let it work - no roll needed. If they're being smart but there's still risk, give them **Edge**.

**Give out Boost Dice.** Don't hoard them. They reset each session and won't break anything. Good ideas, playing up hindrances, making the table laugh - all worth a Boost Die.

**Make rulings from understanding.** When you know the motivations and the mechanics of the world, calls are easy. Ask yourself: what makes sense here?

**The world isn't finished.** It develops during play. The players shape it. Tell them this upfront - it sets the right expectations.

**Keep the rules in the background.** The rules support player ideas, they don't constrain them. "Do what you think is right, and we'll figure it out."

## Before Your First Session

Tell your players:

- *"The world isn't complete - it develops during play, and you will shape it."*
- *"Don't worry about your character sheet. Do what makes sense for your character and we'll figure out the rules."*
- *"I'm not here to tell a story. I'm here to see what happens."*
