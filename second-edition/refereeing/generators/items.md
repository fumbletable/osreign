# Item Generator

These tables combine to create items, treasures, and artifacts. Roll on multiple tables and combine the results - the same combination means different things depending on context.

**The philosophy:** "A gold necklace" is forgettable. "A tarnished silver locket containing a portrait of a child" creates questions. These tables help you create the second kind.

## How to Use These Tables

### Reading d66 Tables

Roll two six-sided dice. The first die picks the row (1-6), the second picks the column (1-6). A roll of 3,5 means row 3, column 5.

### The Formula System

Pick or roll a formula, then roll on the indicated tables:

| d6 | Formula | Example |
|---:|---------|---------|
| 1 | Material + Form | Bone Ring |
| 2 | Color + Form | Crimson Mask |
| 3 | Quality + Form | Ancient Crown |
| 4 | Quality + Material + Form | Cracked Obsidian Bowl |
| 5 | Color + Material + Form | Verdigris Bronze Mirror |
| 6 | Quality + Color + Material + Form | Ornate Crimson Bone Cup |

For **magical items**, add Effect and optionally Quirk:

| d6 | Magical Formula | Example |
|---:|-----------------|---------|
| 1 | Effect + Form | Whispering Blade |
| 2 | Effect + Material + Form | Burning Salt Chain |
| 3 | Material + Effect + Form | Iron Devouring Mask |
| 4 | Quality + Effect + Form | Ancient Binding Crown |
| 5 | Effect + Form (Quirk) | Screaming Mirror (Jealous) |
| 6 | Full combination (Quirk) | Forgotten Bone Weeping Skull (Hungry) |

### Context Determines Power

The same combination means different things based on where it's found:

**Crimson + Bone + Cup**
- **Mundane treasure:** A drinking cup carved from stained bone. Worth 15gp to the right buyer.
- **Minor magic:** A cup that fills with blood-red wine once per day. The wine is nourishing but tastes of copper.
- **Major magic:** Drink from it while holding bones to speak with their former owner. One question per use.
- **Epic artifact:** "The Skull-Cup of Marath" - any bones placed within reform into a loyal skeleton servant.

## Using Multiple Effect Tables

For complex items, roll on both Effect tables:

**Elemental + Spiritual combinations:**
- Burning + Binding = Chains of fire that hold what they touch
- Freezing + Whispering = Ice that speaks the last words of the frozen
- Bleeding + Watching = A wound that lets you see through the injured

---

## Example Generation

**Rolling a Major magic item:**

1. **Formula:** Effect + Material + Form (Worn) + Quirk
2. **Rolls:** Effect (Spiritual) 3,2 = Sealing | Material 1,4 = Silver | Form (Worn) 2,5 = Medallion | Quirk 3,4 = Possessive
3. **Raw result:** Sealing Silver Medallion (Possessive)
4. **Interpretation:** A silver medallion that can seal a single spell within it. Once used, it refuses to seal anything else until the original spell is released - even if that takes years.

**Rolling mundane treasure:**

1. **Formula:** Quality + Color + Material + Form (Mundane)
2. **Rolls:** Quality 3,4 = Jeweled | Color 1,3 = Rust | Material 6,3 = Horn | Form (Mundane) 1,2 = Chalice
3. **Raw result:** Jeweled rust-colored horn chalice
4. **Interpretation:** A drinking horn set with garnets, the horn itself stained dark red from years of wine. Worth 200gp, but the garnets are worth more removed - if you can find a buyer who won't ask where it came from.
