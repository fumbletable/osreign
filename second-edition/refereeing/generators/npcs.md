# NPCs & Factions

These tables create memorable characters and organizations. Many tables work for both - the same Motivation that drives a bitter innkeeper can drive a guild of assassins.

**The philosophy:** "A thieves' guild" is forgettable. "A network of debt collectors who never forget a slight, led by a woman with a noble's bearing and a debtor's brand on her wrist" creates questions. These tables help you create the second kind.

## How to Use These Tables

### Reading d66 Tables

Roll two six-sided dice. The first die picks the row (1-6), the second picks the column (1-6). A roll of 3,5 means row 3, column 5.

### NPC Formulas

| d6 | Formula | Example |
|---:|---------|---------|
| 1 | Detail + Demeanor | Scarred + Nervous |
| 2 | Detail + Voice | One-eyed + Mumbles |
| 3 | Demeanor + Motivation | Cold + Revenge |
| 4 | Detail + Demeanor + Occupation | Branded + Quiet + Merchant |
| 5 | Detail + Demeanor + Voice + Motivation | Hunched + Bitter + Pauses + Knowledge |
| 6 | Full (add Secret + Method) | All of above + Murder + Patience |

### Faction Formulas

| d6 | Formula | Example |
|---:|---------|---------|
| 1 | Type + Motivation | Criminal ring + Wealth |
| 2 | Type + Method | Cult + Manipulation |
| 3 | Type + Motivation + Secret | Noble house + Power + Forbidden knowledge |
| 4 | Type + Motivation + Method | Guild + Control + Alliances |
| 5 | Type + Resources + Reputation | Conspiracy + Information + Feared |
| 6 | Full (add Structure) | All of above + Cells |

### Same Tables, Different Scale

**Motivation: Revenge + Method: Patience**
- **NPC:** A quiet innkeeper who serves the man who ruined him, waiting for the right moment
- **Faction:** A guild that keeps meticulous records of every slight, repaying them years later

**Secret: Forbidden knowledge + Reputation: Respected**
- **NPC:** The village priest everyone trusts, who reads from a book he should have burned
- **Faction:** The scholarly order whose libraries contain things that would see them hanged

## Name Tables

### How Names Work

Each ancestry has **roots** and **endings**. You can:
1. Use a root alone as a short name (Bran, Kaz, Pip)
2. Combine root + ending for a full name (Bran + -wen = Branwen)
3. Combine two roots for a compound name (Bran + Kaz = Brankaz)

Roll once for a quick name. Roll twice and combine for variety.

## Connecting NPCs and Factions

| d6 | Relationship |
|---:|--------------|
| 1 | Leader / founder / face |
| 2 | Loyal member / true believer |
| 3 | Reluctant member / trapped |
| 4 | Secret member / spy |
| 5 | Former member / exile |
| 6 | Enemy / target / rival |

Roll for any NPC: what's their connection to a faction?

---

## Example Generations

**Quick NPC:**

1. **Rolls:** Detail 2,4 = Stained | Demeanor 2,4 = Sly | Voice 4,2 = Avoids eyes
2. **Result:** Someone with stained hands, sly manner, won't meet your gaze
3. **At the table:** "The woman behind the counter has dark stains on her fingers. She smiles too easily and never quite looks at you directly."

**Important NPC:**

1. **Rolls:** Detail 3,4 = Crooked | Demeanor 6,3 = Obsequious | Voice 2,2 = Pauses | Occupation 3,3 = Moneylender | Motivation 1,3 = Revenge | Secret 3,1 = Massacre | Method 5,5 = Waiting
2. **Human name:** Aldric (Ald + -ric)
3. **Result:** Aldric the moneylender - crooked posture, overly servile, pauses mid-sentence, seeking revenge, witnessed (or caused?) a massacre, waiting
4. **Interpretation:** Aldric bows too much and pauses as if listening for something. He was a soldier whose unit was slaughtered - or did the slaughtering. Now he lends money, collects information on everyone who owes him, and waits.

**Faction:**

1. **Rolls:** Type 4,2 = Heretical sect | Motivation 4,4 = Discovery | Secret 4,4 = Dark bargain | Method 4,4 = Infiltration | Resources 3,4 = Ancient texts | Reputation 4,4 = Secretive
2. **Result:** Heretical sect seeking discovery, made a dark bargain, infiltrates other organizations, controls ancient texts, known to be secretive
3. **Interpretation:** The Seekers of the Seventh Truth - a hidden sect that has placed members in churches and libraries across the realm. They search for a specific text prophesied to reveal something. What they traded to learn this, they won't say.

## Expanding These Tables

Add entries that fit your world:

- **Ancestry-specific occupations** (Dwarven miners, Elven bowyers)
- **Regional name variations** (Northern humans vs Southern)
- **Campaign-specific factions** (The Empire's spy network, the Merchant Princes)
- **Local secrets** (Everyone in this town knows about the murders)

**Faction names:** Try combining words from Items tables (Colors, Materials, Effects) with group nouns: "The Crimson Circle", "The Iron Brotherhood", "The Whispering Hand". Or use an NPC name: "Aldric's Wolves", "The Children of Thalys".

The system grows with use.
