# Traps & Hazards

Traps reward careful play and punish haste. They're not gotchas — they're puzzles with consequences.

---

## The Core Principle

**Player skill over character skill.** When players describe how they test for or disarm a trap, adjudicate based on logic. If their method would work, it works — no roll needed. Dice are for uncertainty, not for bypassing clever thinking.

---

## Telegraph Danger

Good traps have clues. The more dangerous the trap, the more obvious the warning signs should be:

- Scorch marks on the walls near a fire trap
- A skeleton slumped against a door
- Dust patterns that show where others have stepped (or haven't)
- The faint smell of oil, or the glint of wire

If they're paying attention and asking questions, give them information. If they're rushing, let them find out the hard way.

## Finding Traps

**Targeted testing:** If players describe a sensible precaution — prodding with a pole, tossing pebbles, checking for tripwires — and it would reveal the trap, it does. Reward the clever play.

**Room search:** If they search without a specific method ("I search for traps"), call for a **WIS check**. DC depends on how well-hidden: Easy (DC 8) for a crude pit, Hard (DC 16) for a master-crafted pressure plate. This takes 1 Turn.

**Trap Expert feat:** Characters with this Expert feat roll with EDGE to find, disable, or set traps.

## Triggering Traps

Undetected traps trigger when someone walks into them. Decide the effect based on the trap:

- **Direct damage:** Arrow trap (1d6), pit trap (2d6 fall), blade (1d8)
- **Save or effect:** Poison needle (CON save or poisoned), sleep gas (CON save or unconscious), net (DEX save or restrained)

Triggered traps make noise. Nearby creatures hear it; if no one's close, roll the hazard die.

## Disarming Traps

When players describe *how* they're disarming — cutting the tripwire, jamming the mechanism, wedging the pressure plate — adjudicate whether it would work. Good plans succeed without a roll.

**Uncertain methods:** Call for a **DEX check (DC 12)**. Failure means the trap triggers. Use common sense about who's affected — a failed disarm of a pit trap might drop the character in; a failed disarm of a dart trap fires into the corridor.

**Tools help.** Thieves' tools, spikes, wire — improvising without proper tools means SETBACK.

**Magical traps** may require *Dispel Magic* or special knowledge to disarm.

---

## Environmental Hazards

Not all dangers are mechanical:

- **Collapsing floors/ceilings** — DEX check to leap clear, or STR check to brace
- **Flooding / Poison gas** — CON check or gain Fatigue (or worse)
- **Mold, slime, fungus** — contact causes disease, poison, or ongoing harm
- **Chasms, lava, unstable bridges** — no save; describe consequences, let players decide risk

---

## Time & Pressure

Every trap interaction costs time:

- **Searching:** 1 Turn
- **Disarming:** 1 Turn
- **Triggering:** Immediate — plus noise alerts the dungeon

The Turn spent means the hazard die rolls, torches burn, and Supply ticks down. This is the pressure that makes traps matter.
