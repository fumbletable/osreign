# Traps & Hazards

Traps enforce caution. They slow exploration, drain time, and punish reckless play.

---

## Detecting Traps
- **Passive:** If characters take sensible precautions (10-ft pole, probing, sand on floor, etc.), Referee may reveal clues.
- **Active Search:** Costs 1 Turn. Roll WIS save (Normal 12).
  - Success: trap found.
  - Failure: trap missed (Referee rolls secretly).
- **Specialists:** Experts/Thieves' Tools grant EDGE.

---

## Triggering Traps
- Most traps trigger if not detected.
- Referee decides effect:
  - **Damage:** roll dice (e.g., 1d6 arrows, 2d6 pitfall).
  - **Save or Effect:** poison, sleep gas, collapse.
- Always consumes time and usually makes noise.

---

## Disarming Traps
- Requires tools (thieves' tools, wires, spikes).
- DEX save (Normal 12). Fail = trap goes off.
- Without tools: improvised attempts at SETBACK.
- Magical traps may require dispel or special lore.

---

## Hazards
Not all dangers are mechanical traps. Examples:
- **Collapsing floors/ceilings** — STR or DEX save to avoid.
- **Flooding / Poison gas** — CON save or Fatigue/damage.
- **Mold, slime, fungus** — contact causes disease, poison, or ongoing harm.
- **Environmental perils** — lava, chasms, unstable bridges.

---

## Noise & Time
- **Searching:** 1 Turn.
- **Disarming:** 1 Turn.
- **Triggering:** always noisy — may cause immediate Encounter check.

---

## Notes
- Encourage players to describe *how* they test or disarm.
- Referee adjudicates based on logic, not just dice.
- Every Turn spent = risk: burning torches, draining provisions, and more rolls for wandering monsters.
