# Treasure Tables

Treasure is the primary source of XP in OSwR. These tables help generate rewards quickly.

## Quick Generation

**Fast method:** Roll d6 + dungeon level for the hoard, then roll d6 for each item type. If you need specifics, drill into the subtype tables.

**Lazy method:** Pick items that make sense for the dungeon and its inhabitants. A goblin lair has crude weapons and stolen coins. A dragon's hoard has everything.

## Placing Treasure

Not every room has treasure. When stocking a dungeon:

- **Monster lairs:** Usually have treasure (they collected it)
- **Empty rooms:** 1-in-6 chance of hidden treasure
- **Trapped areas:** Often guard something valuable
- **Boss chambers:** The biggest hoard
