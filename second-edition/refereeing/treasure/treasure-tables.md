## What Kind of Item?

When you need to determine what type of item is found:

| d6 | Item Type |
|---:|-----------|
| 1 | Potion |
| 2 | Scroll |
| 3 | Weapon |
| 4 | Armor or Shield |
| 5 | Wondrous Item |
| 6 | Wondrous Item |

For weapons and armor, use the [Generators](../generators) to determine appearance. For wondrous items, roll on the generator tables to create something unique.

## Potions (d6)

| d6 | Minor | Major | Epic |
|---:|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | Healing (1d6+1) | Greater Healing (2d6+2) | Supreme Healing (4d6+4) |
| 2 | Climbing | Invisibility | Invulnerability |
| 3 | Water Breathing | Gaseous Form | Etherealness |
| 4 | Darkvision | Haste | Giant Strength |
| 5 | Resistance (1 type) | Heroism | Longevity |
| 6 | Antidote | Fire Resistance | Flying |

**Weird potions:** Use the [Generators](../generators) with Effect + Form for strange potions. "Whispering + Vial" might be a potion that lets you hear distant conversations.

---

## Scrolls (d6)

Roll spell tier based on treasure tier:
- **Minor:** Tier 1–2 spells
- **Major:** Tier 3–4 spells
- **Epic:** Tier 5–6 spells

| d6 | Scroll Contains |
|---:|-----------------|
| 1–2 | Arcane spell (Magic-User list) |
| 3–4 | Divine spell (Cleric list) |
| 5 | Druid spell |
| 6 | Protection scroll (vs specific creature type) |

---

## Mundane Treasure

Not all treasure is magical. Use [Generators](../generators) to make mundane treasure interesting.

| d6 | Type | Minor Value | Major Value | Epic Value |
|---:|------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | Gemstones | 20–200 gp | 200–1,000 gp | 2,000+ gp |
| 2 | Coins | Ancient, unusual | Trade bars | Royal mint |
| 3 | Map | Fragment | Complete | Legendary location |
| 4 | Art object | Decorative | Masterwork | Priceless |
| 5 | Trade goods | Spices, dyes | Rare materials | Unique components |
| 6 | Documents | Letters, deeds | Contracts, secrets | State secrets |

**Make it specific:** Roll on the generator tables even for mundane treasure. "Gemstones worth 200gp" becomes "six polished amber stones, each carved with a weeping face." Specificity creates questions. Questions create adventures.

## Placing Treasure

Not every room has treasure. When stocking a dungeon:

- **Monster lairs:** Usually have treasure (they collected it)
- **Empty rooms:** 1-in-6 chance of hidden treasure
- **Trapped areas:** Often guard something valuable
- **Boss chambers:** The biggest hoard

## Quick Reference

1. Roll d6 + dungeon level for hoard size
2. Roll d6 to determine each item type
3. Use [Generators](../generators) to describe items
