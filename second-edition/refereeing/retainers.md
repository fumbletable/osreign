# Retainers — Loyalty & Morale

Retainers are largely ignored in modern 5E play, but they are vital in OSwR.
Because hit points are lower and combat is deadlier, bringing extra help can mean the difference between survival and disaster. Retainers carry torches, haul loot, and sometimes fight at your side. They can also grow with you: retainers gain XP, and one may step forward as a new character if a hero falls.

---

**Who they are:** Anyone the Referee allows (commoners, mercenaries, adventurers).
- **Lower-level** retainers: expect a half share of treasure.
- **Equal-level** retainers: demand a full share.
- Higher-level retainers will not follow.

**Max Retainers:** PB + CHA modifier (minimum 0).

**Rolls:** Use your **Retainer modifier** (see table below) for hiring, loyalty, and morale.

| CHA Modifier | Retainer Modifier |
|-------------:|------------------:|
| Negative | −1 |
| 0 | 0 |
| +1 or +2 | +1 |
| +3 or more | +2 |

**Pay:** 2–5 gp/day, plus their share of treasure. Extra gear or a promised trinket = +1 to the hire roll.

---

## Hiring (Reaction)

- **Find candidates:** tavern/guild/notice → 1d3 available (double in large towns).
- **Offer terms:** daily pay, treasure share, perks.
- **Reaction roll:** 2d6 + Retainer modifier + offer mods.

| Roll | Result |
|-----:|--------|
| 2–5 | Refuse; reputation here suffers (−1 to future hires until repaired). |
| 6–8 | Hesitant; you may "sweeten it" once (better pay/share/gear) and reroll. |
| 9–11 | Accept. |
| 12+ | Accept eagerly — start with +1 Loyalty. |

**Offer mods:** generous pay (≥5 gp/day) +1; full share +1; good rep +1; stingy −1; reckless rep −1.

---

## Loyalty (between adventures)

Each retainer tracks a **Loyalty mod** (starts at 0, range −3…+3).
Add your **Retainer modifier** to all Loyalty rolls.

- **When to check:** after each adventure or when ordered into exceptional danger.
- **Roll:** 2d6 + Loyalty mod + Retainer modifier.
  - 8+ → they stay on.
  - 12 → impressed; Loyalty +1.
  - Fail → they quit, desert, or demand a bonus (Referee decides).

**Adjustments after a delve:**
- Issued permanent gear they keep: +1
- Bonus treasure or extra pay: +1
- Needlessly risked or abused: −1
- Saved their life: +1

*(Fair shares are baseline; shorted or late pay = they leave immediately.)*

---

## Morale (in combat)

Retainers check morale when the fight turns grim — see [Morale](../players/morale/) for triggers.

**Roll:** 2d6 + Loyalty mod + Retainer modifier.
- 8+ → they hold.
- 12 → rally — no more morale checks this fight.
- Fail → withdraw, flee, or break (Referee decides).

## Optional Knobs

- **Death payout:** pay wergild (≈50 gp/level) to kin to avoid −1 to local hiring.
- **Reputation clock:** each retainer death ticks a 6-segment clock; when full, hiring gets harder until you mend your name.
- **Generous terms:** consistently overpaying or granting spoils may grant **EDGE** on Loyalty rolls at the Referee's discretion.
- **XP growth:** Retainers can gain XP if they survive adventures. With time, they may rise in level — or step in as a replacement character if needed.
