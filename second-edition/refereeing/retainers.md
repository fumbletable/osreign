# Retainers — Loyalty & Morale

Retainers make dangerous dungeons survivable. They carry torches, haul loot, watch the rear, and sometimes fight alongside the party. When a character dies, a loyal retainer can step forward as a replacement — they already know the group, the mission, and the dangers.

---

**Who they are:** Anyone — commoners, mercenaries, adventurers. Lower-level retainers expect a half share of treasure; equal-level demand a full share. Higher-level NPCs won't follow.

**Max Retainers:** A character can lead PB + CHA retainers (minimum 0).

**Retainer Modifier:** Compress CHA for all retainer rolls:

| CHA | Modifier |
|-----|:--------:|
| Negative | −1 |
| 0 | 0 |
| +1 to +2 | +1 |
| +3 or more | +2 |

**Pay:** 2–5 gp/day, plus their share of treasure.

---

## Hiring

**Find candidates:** Taverns, guilds, notice boards — 1d3 available (double in large towns).

**The roll:** 2d6 + Retainer modifier. Adjust for context: generous pay, full shares, good reputation grant +1; stingy terms or a reckless reputation give −1.

| Roll | Result |
|-----:|--------|
| 2–5 | Refuse — and the party's reputation here suffers |
| 6–8 | Hesitant — they can sweeten the deal once and reroll |
| 9–11 | Accept |
| 12+ | Accept eagerly — starts with Loyalty +1 |

---

## Loyalty

Each retainer has a **Loyalty** score (starts at 0, range −3 to +3).

**When to check:** After each adventure, or when ordered into exceptional danger.

**The roll:** 2d6 + Loyalty + Retainer modifier.
- **8+** — they stay on
- **12+** — impressed; Loyalty increases by 1
- **Fail** — they quit, desert, or demand a bonus

**What shifts Loyalty:**
- Gave them gear they keep: +1
- Bonus treasure or extra pay: +1
- Saved their life: +1
- Needlessly risked or abused them: −1

Fair shares are baseline. Shorted or late pay means they leave immediately.

## Morale

Retainers check morale when the fight turns grim — same triggers as monsters (first ally down, half the group down, leader killed, overwhelming odds).

**Retainer Morale:** 7 + Loyalty + Retainer modifier

Roll **2d6** against their Morale:
- **Over** — they break (flee, surrender, or withdraw)
- **Equal or under** — they hold

A well-treated retainer with Loyalty +2 and a +2 Retainer modifier has Morale 11 — nearly fearless. A mistreated one might have Morale 4 and run at the first sign of trouble.

## Optional Knobs

- **Death payout:** Paying wergild (≈50 gp/level) to a dead retainer's kin avoids −1 to local hiring.
- **Reputation clock:** Each retainer death ticks a 6-segment clock; when full, hiring gets harder until the party mends their name.
- **Generous terms:** Consistently overpaying may grant EDGE on Loyalty rolls.
- **XP growth:** Retainers gain XP if they survive. Over time, they may level up — or step in as a replacement character.
