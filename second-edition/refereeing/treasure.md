# Treasure

Treasure drives the game. Every gold piece recovered from a dangerous location grants 1 XP—making wealth the primary measure of success.

## Why Treasure-for-XP?

This system rewards clever play over combat. Sneaking past the dragon to grab its hoard is smarter than fighting it—the gold is worth far more XP than the kill.

When players know that treasure equals advancement, they:
- Scout before fighting
- Negotiate when possible
- Take risks for the big score
- Retreat to fight another day

Combat becomes a tool, not a goal. That's intentional.

## XP Values

| Source | XP Value |
|--------|----------|
| Coins, gems, jewelry | 1 XP per 1 GP value |
| Art objects | Appraised value = XP |
| Trade goods | Market value = XP |
| Magic items | No XP (the item is the reward) |
| Monsters defeated | HD² × 10 |

**Recovered, not found.** Treasure only grants XP when brought back to civilization. A hoard discovered but left behind is worth nothing until claimed.

**Magic items grant no XP** because their utility is the reward. This prevents "magic item farming" and keeps the focus on portable wealth.

**Monster XP is secondary.** A dragon's hoard might be worth 10,000 XP. The dragon itself? 810 XP (9 HD² × 10). The math speaks for itself.
