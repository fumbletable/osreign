# Treasure

Treasure is the primary source of XP in OSwR. Every gold piece recovered from a dangerous location grants 1 XP.

## Treasure Tiers

### Minor (Common)
- Simple bonuses or expendables: +1 items, potions, scrolls, trinkets.
- Frequent; found in small hoards or on lesser foes.
- Value: baseline currency for trade and barter.

### Major (Rare)
- Stronger bonuses or multi-use items: +2 gear, relics, versatile effects.
- Rewards major encounters or deep-level discoveries.
- Value: 10× Minor; often gated by settlement size or contacts.

### Epic (Legendary)
- Singular artifacts, legendary relics, items with names or histories.
- Found only in high-risk dungeons or narrative milestones.
- Value: 100× Minor; trade and duplication impossible.

## Treasure and XP

| Source | XP Value |
|--------|----------|
| Gold, silver, gems | 1 XP per 1 GP value |
| Art objects | Appraised value = XP |
| Magic items | No direct XP (value is in use) |
| Monster defeat | HD² × 10 (secondary to treasure) |

**Design note:** Treasure-for-XP encourages clever play. Sneaking past the dragon to grab the hoard is smarter than fighting it — the gold is worth more XP than the kill.
