# Olde Swords Reign

**Four classes. Infinite archetypes. Real danger.**

OSwR gives you the character customisation you want while keeping the danger, resource tension, and emergent play that makes OSR games sing.

---

## What's This Game For?

- Running classic modules (Keep on the Borderlands, etc.) with modern expectations
- Dangerous adventures where your choices matter
- Emergent storytelling through systems, not scripts
- Grit without learning an unfamiliar ruleset

## What OSwR Isn't

- Not superhero fantasy - danger stays real at every level
- Not old-school frustration - you hit things, you just might die doing it
- Not rules-light - the mechanics have teeth

---

## Core Design

- **4 classes** - Fighter, Expert, Cleric, Magic-User
- **Feats build archetypes** - Ranger, Paladin, Bard emerge from combinations
- **EDGE/SETBACK** - +/-1d6 replaces advantage/disadvantage
- **Boost Dice** - Session-based resource pool for dramatic moments
- **Danger stays real** - Lower HP, meaningful death, no safety nets
- **Resource management matters** - Encumbrance, light, rest cycles

## Simple Rules, Real Depth

Everything runs on a few core ideas - EDGE/SETBACK is just +/-1d6, weapons fit into three categories, DCs are 8/12/16. That's it.

But simple doesn't mean shallow. Those three weapon categories completely change how classes play. EDGE and SETBACK create tactical positioning without a grid. The maths is easy to run, but the choices matter.

You'll learn OSwR in one session. You'll still be finding new angles a year later.
