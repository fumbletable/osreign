# Olde Swords Reign

**Four classes. Infinite archetypes. Real danger.**

OSwR gives players the character customisation they want while keeping the danger, resource tension, and emergent play that makes OSR games sing.

---

## What Is This Game For?

- Running classic modules (Keep on the Borderlands, etc.) with modern player expectations
- Dangerous adventures where choices matter
- Emergent storytelling through systems, not scripts
- Tables that want grit without learning an unfamiliar ruleset

## What OSwR Is NOT For

- Superhero fantasy (go play 5e)
- "Roll to see if you miss again" frustration (go play B/X)
- Rules-light improv with no mechanical teeth (go play Knave)

---

## Core Design

- **4 classes** - Fighter, Expert, Cleric, Magic-User
- **Feats build archetypes** - Ranger, Paladin, Bard emerge from combinations
- **EDGE/SETBACK** - +/-1d6 replaces advantage/disadvantage
- **Boost Dice** - Session-based resource pool for dramatic moments
- **Danger stays real** - Lower HP, meaningful death, no safety nets
- **Resource management matters** - Encumbrance, light, rest cycles
