Downloads and reference materials for Olde Swords Reign.

## Downloads

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[Alpha PDF](https://github.com/fumbletable/osreign/releases/download/alpha-latest/Olde-Swords-Reign-Alpha.pdf)** | For offline reading and printing |
| **[EPUB](downloads/olde-swords-reign.epub)** | For e-readers (Kobo, Apple Books, etc.) |

Both files update automatically whenever the rules change. For Kindle, use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to convert the EPUB to MOBI.

### What's in the Alpha?

This PDF contains the complete current state of the rules - everything you see on this website, formatted for print. It includes:

- Full Player's Guide (character creation, classes, feats, equipment, rules)
- Referee's Guide (principles, exploration, bestiary, treasure)
- All the latest updates and additions

### Live Development

OSwR Second Edition is being developed in the open. Here's how it works:

1. **Rules are written** on this website as markdown files
2. **Every update** to the rules automatically triggers a new PDF build
3. **The PDF** is generated from the same source as the website - they're always in sync
4. **You always get the latest** - the download link above always points to the most recent version

This means you're seeing the game evolve in real-time. Some sections may be incomplete or change between downloads. That's intentional - we'd rather you have access to work-in-progress rules than wait for a "finished" product.

### Version History

Check the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/fumbletable/osreign/releases) to see what's changed between versions or download older builds.
