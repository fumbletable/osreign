# How to Play

When the outcome's uncertain, you roll dice.

## Checks

Roll d20 + ability + Proficiency Bonus (PB) if it applies. Beat the Difficulty Class (DC) and you succeed. Fall short and something goes wrong—but never a dead end. Every roll should push the story forward.

**Proficiency Bonus (PB):** Your PB is +2 at levels 1–4, +3 at levels 5–8, and +4 at levels 9–12. Add it to attacks with proficient weapons, proficient saves, and checks where your class, background, or feats apply.

---

## Saving Throws

When something nasty happens to you—a trap springs, a spell hits, the floor gives way—you make a saving throw. Roll d20 + ability (+ PB if you've got it). Beat the DC and you avoid or reduce the harm. Fail and it hits you full force.

*Example: Poison gas fills the room. CON save to resist.*

---

## Difficulty Classes

| DC | Difficulty | Example |
|---:|------------|---------|
| 8 | Easy | Climb a knotted rope |
| 12 | Normal | Cross a narrow ledge |
| 16 | Hard | Decipher ancient text |
| 20 | Extreme | Leap a 30-ft chasm |

Most checks are DC 12. The Referee sets the DC based on how hard the task actually is, and may adjust it for circumstances.

---

## Contests

When you're directly opposing someone—arm wrestling, grappling, a tug-of-war—both sides roll. Highest total wins. On a tie, nothing changes (or the Referee adds a small complication).

---

## Group Checks

When the whole party attempts something together, everyone rolls. If at least half succeed, the group succeeds.

---

## Edge and Setback

When circumstances favor you, you have **Edge**—add 1d6 to your roll.

When circumstances work against you, you have **Setback**—subtract 1d6 from your roll.

**Edge** and **Setback** can stack. Two sources of **Edge** means +2d6. One **Edge** and one **Setback** cancel out.

---

## Boost Dice

Boost Dice are a personal resource you spend to enhance your actions. You start each session with Boost Dice equal to your **PB**. Your maximum pool also equals your PB. They don't carry over—use them or lose them.

**Basic use:** Spend 1 Boost Die to add 1d6 to any roll. Declare it before or after you roll.

**Recovery:** When you roll a natural 1 on any d20 roll, gain 1 Boost Die (up to your maximum). Failure teaches.

**Earning more:** The Referee may award Boost Dice when you play up your hindrances (character flaws—see [Hindrances](character/hindrances)), do something memorable, or make the game more fun.

**Class abilities:** Each class also has special ways to spend Boost Dice—see your class description for details.

---

## General Principles

**Specific beats general.** If a feat, spell, or item contradicts a broader rule, the specific one wins.

**Round down.** Always. HP, XP, damage—if there's a fraction, drop it.

# Key Terms

The vocabulary you'll see throughout this book.

---

## Ranges

How far things are from you.

| Range | Distance | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Close** | Within 5 ft | Melee range, a whisper |
| **Near** | Within 30 ft | Thrown weapons, normal conversation |
| **Far** | 30–120 ft | Bows and crossbows, a shout |
| **Very Far** | Beyond 120 ft | Out of weapon range, often out of sight |

---

## Speeds

How fast you move.

| Speed | Per Round | Notes |
|-------|----------:|-------|
| **Slow** | 15 ft | Sneaking, encumbered, difficult terrain |
| **Normal** | 30 ft | Standard movement |
| **Fast** | 45 ft | Unencumbered, urgent |

Heavy armor, overloaded packs, or difficult conditions drop your Speed by one step.

---

## Time

How long things take.

| Unit | Duration | When You Use It |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Round** | 6 seconds | Combat—one turn per combatant |
| **Turn** | 10 minutes | Dungeon exploration—searching, picking locks |
| **Watch** | 6 hours | Wilderness travel, long rests (4 Watches = 1 day) |

---

## Rests

How you recover.

| Rest Type | Duration | What You Get |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Breather** | 10 minutes | Spend Hit Dice to heal, clear 1 Fatigue |
| **Night's Rest** | 8 hours | Regain half your Hit Dice, clear all Fatigue |
| **Safe Haven** | 1 week in safety | Full HP, all Hit Dice, remove lingering conditions |

Rests require 1 **Supply** per person (food, water, bandages).

---

## Resources

What you track and spend.

| Resource | What It Is |
|----------|------------|
| **Supply** | Abstract provisions—food, water, bandages. Spend 1 per rest. |
| **Fatigue** | Exhaustion from forced marches, missed sleep, harsh conditions. Each level gives **Setback** on all rolls. 5 Fatigue = collapse. |
| **Hit Dice** | Your recovery pool. Spend during Breathers to heal (roll + CON per die). |
| **Boost Die** | Spendable resource (PB per session). Spend 1 to add 1d6 to any roll, or use for class abilities. Recover 1 on a natural 1. |

---

## Conditions

States that affect you.

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Blinded** | Can't see. Auto-fail sight-based checks. Attacks have **Setback**, attacks against you have **Edge**. |
| **Charmed** | Regard the charmer as a trusted ally. Can't attack them. |
| **Deafened** | Can't hear. Auto-fail hearing-based checks. |
| **Frightened** | **Setback** on checks and attacks while you can see the source. Can't willingly move closer. |
| **Grappled** | Speed 0. Can't move until you break free (contest of STR). |
| **Incapacitated** | Can't take actions or reactions. |
| **Paralyzed** | Can't move, speak, or act. Attacks against you have **Edge** and auto-crit from **Close**. |
| **Poisoned** | **Setback** on attacks and checks. |
| **Prone** | **Setback** on attacks. Melee attacks against you have **Edge**. Stand up costs half movement. |
| **Restrained** | Speed 0, your attacks have **Setback**, attacks against you have **Edge**. |
| **Shaken** | **Setback** on attacks and checks. Ends after a Breather or when the source is defeated. |
| **Stunned** | Can't act or move. Auto-fail STR and DEX saves. Attacks against you have **Edge**. |
| **Unconscious** | Incapacitated, can't move or speak, unaware. Drop what you're holding, fall **Prone**. |

# Character Creation

Here's what you'll do:

1. **Roll Abilities** - Determine your STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA
2. **Choose an Ancestry** - Pick a people with unique traits
3. **Choose a Class** - Decide your role in the party
4. **Pick Feats** - Customise with special abilities
5. **Choose a Background** - Define your history
6. **Choose Languages** - Reflect your knowledge of the world
7. **Buy Equipment** - Weapons, armor, and gear

---

## Step 1: Roll Abilities

Pick your method:

- **Standard:** Roll 3d6 six times, assign freely.
- **Down the Line:** Roll 3d6 in order (STR → CHA). No swapping. You get **+1 Feat** for putting your fate in the dice gods' hands.

Look up each roll on the table below - that's your ability. Record only the ability on your sheet; the 3d6 total won't be used again. Your class may grant +1 to a specific ability.

---

### Ability Table

| 3d6 Roll | Ability |
|----------|---------|
| 3        | −4      |
| 4–5      | −3      |
| 6–7      | −2      |
| 8–9      | −1      |
| 10–11    | 0       |
| 12–13    | +1      |
| 14–15    | +2      |
| 16–17    | +3      |
| 18       | +4      |

---

### The Six Abilities

**Strength (STR)**
Physical power, athletics, brute force. You add STR to melee attack and damage rolls. Your carrying capacity is 10 + STR slots (see [Encumbrance](encumbrance)).

**Dexterity (DEX)**
Agility, reflexes, balance. You add DEX to ranged attack rolls (not damage). With a finesse weapon like a dagger or shortsword, you can use DEX for both attack and damage instead of STR. DEX also adds to your AC (Armor Class—how hard you are to hit).

**Constitution (CON)**
Health, stamina, resilience. You add CON to your HP each level.

**Intelligence (INT)**
Memory, reasoning, knowledge. Magic-Users use INT for spell save DCs and spell attacks. You speak Common plus your ancestry's tongue, and gain bonus languages equal to your INT (minimum 0). If your INT is negative, you're illiterate until you gain literacy through a feat, class feature, or tutor.

**Wisdom (WIS)**
Perception, insight, intuition. Clerics use WIS for spell save DCs and spell attacks.

**Charisma (CHA)**
Personality, charm, leadership. CHA affects reaction rolls (how NPCs respond to you), how many [retainers](#hiring-help) you can employ, and social checks like persuasion or intimidation.

---

### Proficiency Bonus (PB)

Your Proficiency Bonus represents your training. It's +2 at levels 1–4, +3 at levels 5–8, and +4 at levels 9–12.

Add your PB to:
- Attacks with weapons you're proficient in
- Saves you're proficient in
- Checks tied to your class, background, or feats

You only add PB once per roll.

---

### Using Abilities

When the outcome's uncertain, the Referee calls for an ability check. Roll d20 + ability (+ PB if it applies). Beat the DC and you succeed. Fall short and something goes wrong.

---

Once you've got your abilities, move on to **Step 2: Choose an Ancestry**.

# Ancestry

Your ancestry is where you come from—and what you can do that others can't.

Choose one of the four core ancestries for your character.

- Everyone speaks **Common** plus their ancestry's tongue (Humans just speak Common).
- **Bonus languages:** If your INT is positive, you gain that many extra languages.
- Each ancestry has 2–3 traits. These can vary for sub-ancestries.

---

## Dwarf
**Size:** Medium · **Languages:** Common, Dwarvish
**Age:** Adult ~40 · Lifespan ~250–400

- **Stone Sense:** You detect unusual stonework. If you pass within 5 ft of slopes, seams, traps, or recent masonry, the Referee may roll a secret INT check for you. When you actively search stonework, roll with **Edge**.
- **Darkvision (30 ft).**
- **Resist Spells:** **Edge** on saves vs spells and spell-like effects.

*Restriction:* Dwarves' innate magic resistance means you can't take Magic-User levels unless the Referee permits an exception.

---

## Elf
**Size:** Medium · **Languages:** Common, Elvish
**Age:** Adult ~100 · Lifespan ~400–1000+

- **Ghoul Immunity:** You're immune to ghoul paralysis.
- **Keen Senses:** **Edge** on sight and hearing checks. **Edge** to avoid being Surprised at **Near** range if you're alert.
- **Secret Door Sense:** If you pass within 5 ft of a hidden door, the Referee may roll a secret WIS check for you. When you actively search, roll with **Edge**.

---

## Halfling
**Size:** Small · **Languages:** Common, Halfling
**Age:** Adult ~20 · Lifespan ~100–150

- **Fearless:** **Edge** on saves vs fear and morale-breaking effects.
- **Small & Quiet:** **Edge** to Hide in wilderness. Creatures larger than you have **Setback** to detect you beyond **Close** if you stay still.
- **Sling Training:** **Edge** on attacks with slings (and thrown stones, if you like).

*Restriction:* You can't wield **Heavy** weapons (polearms, greatswords, etc.).

---

## Human
**Size:** Medium · **Languages:** Common
**Age:** Adult ~15–18 · Lifespan ~70–90

- **Versatile:** +1 to any one ability.
- **Broad Training:** Choose one General Feat you qualify for.

# Build-an-Ancestry

OSwR uses four core ancestries - Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, and Human - but you can easily create new ones.

Each ancestry has **3 traits max** (Humans are the exception). Traits come in a few categories:

- **Sense:** Darkvision (30 ft) or **Edge** on a sense (sight, hearing, smell). Keep darkvision rare.
- **Resist:** **Edge** on one type of save (poison, charm, fear, spells, cold/heat).
- **Knack:** **Edge** on one exploration task (stone sense, find secret doors, woodland stealth, tracking).
- **Quirk:** A small, always-on perk (ignore 1 **Fatigue** once/day, treat **Bulky** as 1 slot, **Edge** on sling attacks).

Pick 2–3 that fit the concept. Don't stack the same category twice.

---

## Sample Ancestries

These examples use the Build-an-Ancestry rules to show how you might create other ancestries.

---

### Shadow Elf
**Size:** Medium · **Languages:** Common, Elvish
**Age:** Adult ~100 · Lifespan ~400–1000+

- **Ghoul Immunity.**
- **Darkvision (30 ft).**
- **Resist Spells:** **Edge** on saves vs spells and magical effects.

*Note:* Shadow Elves are often mistrusted by surface folk. The Referee may apply **Setback** on reaction rolls with NPCs unfamiliar with their culture.

---

### Gnome
**Size:** Small · **Languages:** Common, Gnomish (often Dwarvish too)
**Age:** Adult ~40 · Lifespan ~300–500

- **Stone Sense:** As Dwarves, you detect stonework anomalies. If you pass within 5 ft of slopes, seams, traps, or recent masonry, the Referee may roll a secret INT check. When actively searching stonework, roll with **Edge**.
- **Resist Illusion:** **Edge** on saves vs illusions and trickery.
- **Tinker's Knack:** **Edge** on checks to repair, disassemble, or jury-rig mechanical devices.

*Restriction:* You're Small, so you can't wield **Heavy** weapons (polearms, greatswords, etc.).

# Hindrances (d50)

Nobody's perfect—and flaws make better stories.

Roll or choose one. Hindrances are flaws, weaknesses, or limits that make your character more interesting - and earn you an extra feat at character creation.

# Classes

Your class is your adventuring profession—what you're best at when things go wrong.

OSwR has four base classes: [Cleric](#cleric), [Expert](#expert), [Fighter](#fighter), [Magic-User](#magic-user).
Your class sets your hit points, saves, weapon and armor proficiencies, and what you gain as you level.

This small set is by design. The mix of **Feats** and **multiclassing** lets you shape almost any archetype you want:

- A **Ranger** can grow out of an Expert with wilderness Feats.
- A **Paladin** might be a Fighter with divine Feats, or a multiclass Fighter/Cleric.
- A **Bard** emerges from an Expert with social and magic Feats.
- A **Monk** can be built from an Expert focused on discipline, agility, and unarmed combat Feats.

Rather than dozens of rigid classes, OSwR gives you four broad frameworks and the tools to build the character you imagine.


---

## Unified Cadence
- **Odd levels (1 / 3 / 5 / 7 / 9 / 11):** your class "pop."
  - **Fighter:** +1 Fighter Feat
  - **Expert:** +1 Expert or General Feat (starts with 6 at level 1)
  - **Cleric:** unlock next spell tier (1–6)
  - **Magic-User:** unlock next spell tier (1–6)
- **Even levels (2 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 10 / 12):** +1 General Feat.
- At **levels 4, 8, 12:** +1 to any ability (max +5).
- **Multiclassing:** only at odd levels.

---

## Starting Gear
All characters begin with:
- Backpack
- 6 Torches
- 6 **Supply** (consumable resources for healing and survival—see [Adventuring Gear](#adventuring-gear))
- Wineskin
- 25 gp
- One **Starting Kit** (defined in your class entry), *or* roll `4d4 × 10 gp` and buy your own equipment.

---

## How to Read Class Lines
- **HD:** At 1st level, you take the max of your HD (8 for Fighter, 6 for Cleric/Expert, 4 for Magic-User) + CON.
  At higher levels, roll your class Hit Die (or take the average in parentheses) and add CON.
- **Saves:** These are your proficient saves—add PB and the relevant ability. Non-proficient saves use only the ability.
- **Weapons / Armor:** Listed by **tags**. Add PB to attacks with proficient weapons. Shields give their normal AC bonus.
  Some restrictions apply (e.g., Cleric "Bludgeoning only").
- **Ability Boost:** At level 1, your class grants +1 to a specific ability.
- **Spellcasters:** Cleric & Magic-User use **Spell Slots** with prepared lists. See [Magic Overview](#magic) for preparation and casting.

---

# Advancement

OSwR characters advance from level 1 to 12. This is a game about adventurers, not superheroes—even at high levels, a sword to the gut is dangerous and caution keeps you alive.

---

## Experience Points (XP)

Characters earn XP from **treasure recovered** and **monsters overcome**.

### Treasure XP

**1 XP per 1 GP** of treasure recovered from dangerous locations and returned to civilization.

Treasure must be won through risk. Coins earned through honest work or trade don't count—only wealth pulled from dungeons, ruins, lairs, and other perilous places.

> **Why treasure?** XP for gold creates emergent gameplay. Players sneak past the dragon because fighting is risky and the hoard is what matters. They negotiate with goblins because dead goblins don't lead to treasure. The system rewards clever play without the Referee deciding what counts as "clever."

### Monster XP

Monsters grant XP using the formula: **HD² × 10**

"Overcome" includes defeating, outsmarting, driving off, or otherwise neutralising the threat. You don't have to kill it—you have to deal with it.

### Dividing XP

Divide all XP evenly among surviving party members, including [retainers](#hiring-help) who fought alongside you (they typically receive a half share).

---

## XP by Level

| Level | XP Required | Cumulative |
|------:|------------:|-----------:|
| 1 | — | 0 |
| 2 | 1,500 | 1,500 |
| 3 | 3,000 | 4,500 |
| 4 | 4,500 | 9,000 |
| 5 | 9,000 | 18,000 |
| 6 | 18,000 | 36,000 |
| 7 | 24,000 | 60,000 |
| 8 | 40,000 | 100,000 |
| 9 | 50,000 | 150,000 |
| 10 | 75,000 | 225,000 |
| 11 | 75,000 | 300,000 |
| 12 | 75,000 | 375,000 |

---

## Unified Cadence

All classes follow the same advancement pattern:

- **Odd levels (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11):** Class feature advancement
  - Fighter → +1 Fighter Feat
  - Expert → +1 Expert or General Feat
  - Cleric → unlocks next spell tier (1–6)
  - Magic-User → unlocks next spell tier (1–6)
- **Even levels (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12):** +1 General Feat
- **Levels 4, 8, 12:** +1 to any ability (maximum +5)
- **Multiclassing:** May only add a new class at odd levels (see [Multiclassing](#multiclassing) below)

---

## Proficiency Bonus (PB)

| Level | PB |
|------:|---:|
| 1–4 | +2 |
| 5–8 | +3 |
| 9–12 | +4 |

PB applies to attacks with proficient weapons, proficient saves, and checks involving class, background, or feat abilities.

---

## Training Costs

Levelling up grants the *capacity* for new abilities. Actually gaining them requires time and gold.

### Feats

To learn a new feat (class or general):
- **Time:** 1 week of dedicated training
- **Cost:** 500 gp (equipment, practice, study)

No trainer required—the character trains independently or seeks instruction as part of the fiction.

### Spells

See [Spellbooks & Research](#spellbooks-and-research) for full rules. In summary:
- **Copying a spell:** 1 day/tier, 100 gp/tier
- **Researching a spell:** 1 week/tier, 700 gp/week, INT check

Casters unlock new spell *tiers* at odd levels, but must still acquire individual spells through play.

### Ability Increases

Ability increases at levels 4, 8, and 12 are **free**—no gold or time required.

---

## Multiclassing

You can take levels in multiple classes, gaining their abilities at the cost of slower progression in each.

### Rules

- **Odd levels only:** You may only switch to a different class at odd character levels (3, 5, 7, 9, 11). This means you commit to at least two levels before you can switch again.
- **Proficiency Bonus:** Your PB is based on your total adventurer level, not individual class levels.
- **Proficiencies:** You gain all proficiencies (weapons, armor, saves) of your new class. However, proficiency doesn't override class restrictions—a Magic-User who takes Fighter levels gains armor proficiency but still can't cast spells in armor without the Armored Caster feat.
- **Hit Dice:** Your Hit Dice pool is the sum of all dice gained from your class levels. You can spend these dice in any combination when resting or using abilities that require Hit Dice.
- **Spell tiers:** You unlock spell tiers based on your levels in each casting class separately. Three Cleric levels unlocks Tier 2 divine spells; two Magic-User levels only unlocks Tier 1 arcane spells.
- **Spell slots:** Each casting class has its own spell slot progression based on your levels in that class. They don't combine.

### Example

*Aldric starts as a Fighter. At level 3, he switches to Magic-User. At level 5, he continues as Magic-User. He's now a 5th-level adventurer with 2d8 + 3d4 **Hit Dice**, two Fighter Feats, one General Feat, and access to Tier 2 arcane spells. He has all Fighter weapon and armor proficiencies—but can't cast spells while wearing armor unless he takes the Armored Caster feat.*

# Economy

This page consolidates all economic information for OSwR—what things cost, what adventurers earn, and how gold flows through the game.

---

## Currency

**Standard:** 1 gold piece (gp) is the default unit.

| Coin | Value |
|------|-------|
| Copper (cp) | 1/100 gp |
| Silver (sp) | 1/10 gp |
| Gold (gp) | 1 gp |
| Platinum (pp) | 10 gp |

**Wages baseline:** 1 gp/day for unskilled labor. This anchors all other prices.

**Encumbrance:** 100 coins = 1 slot. Carrying wealth is a logistical problem.

---

## XP & Treasure

**1 XP per 1 GP** of treasure recovered from dangerous locations.

This is the primary advancement engine. See [Advancement](#advancement) for full XP rules.

---

## Banking & Storage

Temples, guilds, and money-changers will store gold securely. Depositing is free. Withdrawing costs a fee.

| Institution | Withdrawal Fee | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Temple bank | 10% | Excellent security. Divine protection. |
| Guild bank | 10% | Good security. May require membership. |
| Money-changer | 10% | Also exchanges gems and foreign coin. |

**Long-term storage:** If gold is left for at least **one month**, withdrawal is **free**. This encourages adventurers to deposit and go adventuring rather than constantly dipping in.

**Loans:** Available at 10% interest per month. Loans over 5 gp require collateral worth twice the loan value.

**Hidden caches:** You can bury or hide treasure yourself. No fee, but the Referee may roll for discovery if enemies learn of it or significant time passes.

---

## Training Costs

Levelling grants capacity. Unlocking abilities costs gold and time.

| Training | Time | Cost |
|----------|------|------|
| Feat (any) | 1 week | 500 gp |
| Ability increase | — | Free |

---

## Magic-User Costs

**The 100 gp/day principle:** Arcane work costs 100 gp per day.

| Activity | Time | Cost |
|----------|------|------|
| Copy spell from source | 1 day/tier | 100 gp/tier |
| Learn from mentor | 1 day/tier | 100 gp/tier + quest |
| Research spell | 1 week/tier | 700 gp/week |
| Backup own spell | 1 hr/tier | 50 gp/tier |
| Spellbook (blank, 20 capacity) | — | 200 gp |

See [Spellbooks & Research](#spellbooks-and-research) for full rules.

---

## Cleric Costs

Clerics don't use spellbooks - they receive spells through divine connection. But maintaining that connection requires ongoing sacrifice.

### Tithes (Required)

Clerics must give **10% of all treasure** to maintain divine favor. This is not optional - a Cleric who fails to tithe will find their spells no longer function until the debt is paid.

| Cleric Type | Tithe To | Form |
|-------------|----------|------|
| Hallowed | Temple | Donations to temple works, charity |
| Druidic | Nature | Offerings at sacred sites, releasing animals, sacrifices, community feasts |

**Hallowed Clerics** give to their temple institution. The gold supports the faith's works.

**Druidic Clerics** return wealth to nature. Gold is consumed, scattered, or given away - offerings at standing stones and sacred groves, releasing captive animals, burning goods as sacrifice, feasting the local community. The treasure goes *back* rather than to an institution.

### Pious Offerings (XP)

Clerics may give *beyond* their tithe to gain XP, as an alternative to carousing.

| Cleric Type | Where | Maximum |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Hallowed | Temple/Cathedral | Settlement limit |
| Druidic | Sacred site | Referee discretion |

Spend gold on offerings, gain equal XP. No mishap roll - the divine accepts your sacrifice.

**Settlement limits:** Village 100 gp, Town 500 gp, City 2,000 gp.

Non-Clerics may donate to temples, but don't gain XP - they're patrons, not faithful.

### Equipment

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Holy symbol (wooden) | 1 gp |
| Holy symbol (silver) | 25 gp |
| Holy symbol (gold) | 100 gp |
| Consecrated water (flask) | 25 gp |
| Prayer book / scriptures | 50 gp |
| Vestments (simple) | 10 gp |
| Vestments (ceremonial) | 100 gp |

---

## Temple Services

Temples offer healing and other services—for a price. Divine magic isn't free; these costs support the temple and its works.

| Tier | Base Cost | Example Services |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | 100 gp | Cure Light Wounds, Bless, Detect Evil |
| 2 | 200 gp | Hold Person, Resist Elements, Silence |
| 3 | 500 gp | Cure Disease, Remove Curse, Dispel Magic |
| 4 | 1,000 gp | Cure Serious Wounds, Neutralize Poison |
| 5 | 2,500 gp | Raise Dead, Commune, True Seeing |
| 6 | 5,000 gp | Heal, Regenerate, Restoration |

**Prices vary.** These are base costs. Actual prices depend on temple relationships, local demand, the recipient's standing with the faith, and circumstances. Faithful members, those who have done service, or adventurers pursuing the temple's goals may receive discounts. Strangers or those of opposing faiths may pay more—or be refused entirely.

**Unavailable:** Not all temples offer all services. Small village shrines may only provide Tier 1-2 spells. Higher-tier magic requires a major temple and a high-level priest—if the temple permits it at all.

---

## Hirelings & Retainers

| Type | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Unskilled hireling | 1 gp/day | Torchbearer, porter. Won't fight. |
| Skilled hireling | 2-5 gp/day | Craftsman, guide, healer. |
| Mercenary | 3-5 gp/day | Armed guard. Won't enter dungeons. |
| Retainer | 2-5 gp/day + half share | Adventuring companion. Shares risk. |

**Wergild:** 50 gp per level of the deceased retainer, paid to their kin if they die in service.

---

## Services

| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Inn (common room) | 5 sp/night |
| Inn (private room) | 2 gp/night |
| Meal (common) | 1 sp |
| Meal (good) | 5 sp |
| Stabling | 5 sp/night |
| Bath house | 3 sp |
| Laundry | 1 sp |
| Sage consultation | 20-100 gp |
| Scribe (letter) | 1 gp |
| Scribe (contract) | 5 gp |
| Ship passage (per day) | 1-5 gp |
| Coach travel (per day) | 2 sp |
| River ferry | 1 sp |
| Guide (wilderness) | 5 gp/day |

---

# Equipment

Here's what you can buy and how much you can carry.

---

## Coins & Wealth

The adventuring economy runs on gold.

- **100 cp = 10 sp = 1 gp**
- You'll use copper for small purchases, silver for everyday goods, and gold for anything serious.

When you sell treasure:
- **Arms & Armor:** You get half value.
- **Gems & Art Objects:** Full value.
- **Magic Items:** Rare - you'll need to negotiate in a major settlement.

---

## Encumbrance (reminder)

You can carry 10 + STR slots. A backpack adds another 10. **Bulky** items take 2 slots.

If you're over capacity, your Speed drops to **Slow** and you make a CON save (DC 12) or gain 1 **Fatigue**.

# Encumbrance

How much you can carry.

---

## Slots

You have **10 + STR** item slots. A backpack adds 10 more (lose the backpack, lose those slots).

**What takes a slot:**
- Most items that don't fit in your palm = 1 slot
- **Bulky** items (plate armor, greataxe, maul, etc.) = 2 slots
- 100 coins = 1 slot

**Containers:**
- **Backpack** — +10 slots (worn)
- **Sack** — +5 slots (requires a free hand)

# Magic

Magic in OSwR uses **spell slots**. Each time you cast a spell, you expend one slot of that spell's tier or higher. Slots refresh after a **Night's Rest** or at a **Safe Haven**.

---

## Casting Basics
- **Caster stat:** Cleric → WIS · Magic-User → INT
- **Save DC:** 8 + PB + WIS or INT
- **Focus:** Cleric → holy symbol (Hallowed) or natural focus (Druidic) · Magic-User → arcane focus

---

## Preparing Spells

**Clerics** pray for their spells. They have access to all spells on their oath's spell list (Hallowed or Druidic) and choose which to prepare each day.

**Magic-Users** study their spellbook. They can only prepare spells they have recorded in their book.

- After a **Night's Rest** or at a **Safe Haven**, prepare spells equal to **level + WIS or INT**.
- Prepared spells form your *daily list*; you may cast any from that list while slots remain.
- You don't need to prepare duplicates — one prep allows multiple casts.
- Changing your list requires another rest.
- **Prep time:** 1 **Turn** (10 min) × highest spell tier prepared.
  - Tier 1 → 10 min · Tier 2 → 20 min · Tier 3 → 30 min · Tier 4 → 40 min · Tier 5 → 50 min · Tier 6 → 60 min

---

## Casting
- **Spend a slot** of that spell's tier or higher; the slot is lost, the spell remains prepared.
- **Boostable:** Some spells can be enhanced by spending a **Boost Die**. See individual spell descriptions.
- All spells require **words and gestures**. You cannot cast if gagged, bound, or unable to move/speak freely.
- **Concentration:** If maintaining a spell, any damage or significant disturbance (Referee's call) forces a **CON save (DC 12)** or the spell ends.

---

## Recovery
- **Breather (10 min):** No slot recovery.
- **Night's Rest (8 hr):** Restore all slots; may change prepared spells.
- **Safe Haven (1d4 + 1 days):** Full reset — HP, slots, Fatigue.

---

| Level | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th |
|------:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|
| 1 | 2 | – | – | – | – | – |

| 11 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| 12 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 |

---

## Ritual Casting

Spells marked with **{Ritual}** can be cast without preparing them first:
- Cast directly from your spellbook (Magic-Users) or prayer (Clerics)
- Add **10 minutes** to the casting time
- Still **consumes a spell slot**

Ritual casting gives flexibility - you can cast spells you didn't prepare that day, but it costs time.

# Spellbooks & Research

How Magic-Users expand their arcane repertoire.

---

## The Spellbook

A Magic-User's spellbook is the center of their world. It holds all the arcane knowledge they've collected and must be studied daily to prepare spells.

**Starting Spellbook:** At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing *Read Magic* plus **(1 + INT)** 1st-tier spells.

**Capacity:** A standard spellbook holds **20 spells**. Cost: **200 gp**.

**Without Your Spellbook:** You cannot prepare new spells. You can only cast spells you already have prepared.

---

## Adding Spells

There are three ways to add spells to your spellbook:

### 1. Copying from a Found Source

When you acquire another Magic-User's spellbook or a spell scroll, you can copy spells into your own book.

**Requirements:**
- Cast *Read Magic* to decipher the notation
- The spell must be of a tier you can cast (you cannot comprehend magic beyond your current ability)

**Time:** 1 day per spell tier

**Cost:** 100 gp per spell tier (inks and materials)

**Scrolls are consumed** when copied. Spellbooks are not.

*Note: This is different from casting a scroll. Casting uses the scroll's magic immediately. Copying transfers the knowledge to your book.*

---

### 2. Learning from a Mentor

A more experienced Magic-User can teach you spells they know.

**The Catch:** Mentors don't give away their secrets for free. They may demand payment, favors, quests, or rare components. The Referee adjudicates what a mentor requires.

**Once a mentor agrees to teach you:** Copy the spell as normal (1 day/tier, 100 gp/tier). The adventure to earn their trust IS the real cost.

---

### 3. Spell Research

Creating a new spell or independently discovering an existing one requires extended study and experimentation. This is the slowest and most expensive path, but requires no luck or negotiation.

**Requirements:**
- Access to a library, laboratory, or arcane workshop
- Rare materials appropriate to the spell's nature
- Uninterrupted time for study
- The spell must be of a tier you can cast

**Time:** 1 week per spell tier

**Cost:** 700 gp per week (materials, texts)

**Check:** At the end of the research period, make an **INT check** to finalise the spell:
- Tier 1-2: Easy (DC 8)
- Tier 3-4: Normal (DC 12)
- Tier 5-6: Hard (DC 16)

**Success:** The spell is added to your spellbook.

**Failure:** The spell doesn't hold. It will take another week of work (700 gp) before you're ready to attempt finalisation again.

---

## Backup Spellbook

Because spellbooks are irreplaceable, wise Magic-Users create backups.

**Copying Your Own Spellbook:**
- Since these spells are already in your notation, it's much faster
- **Time:** 1 hour per spell tier
- **Cost:** 50 gp per spell tier

---

## Scrolls

Scrolls are single-use magical items containing one spell.

### Casting from a Scroll

**Magic-User scrolls** are written in arcane notation. Only Magic-Users can use them:
- If the spell is a tier you can cast: **automatic success**
- If the spell is a higher tier: make an **INT check** (DC 10 + spell tier). Failure wastes the scroll.

**Cleric scrolls** contain divine blessings that anyone can attempt to invoke:
- Clerics: **automatic success** for spells on their oath's list
- Everyone else: make a **WIS check** (DC 10 + spell tier)

Casting from a scroll does **not** expend a spell slot.
The scroll is consumed whether you succeed or fail.

---

## Rituals

Some spells can be cast as rituals - cast without preparing them first, but taking longer.

**Ritual Casting:**
- Cast directly from your spellbook (Magic-Users) or prayer (Clerics)
- Add **10 minutes** to the casting time
- Still **consumes a spell slot**
- Only spells marked as **{Ritual}** can be cast this way

Ritual casting gives flexibility - you can cast spells you didn't prepare that day, but it costs time.

---

## Quick Reference

| Activity | Time | Cost | Check |
|----------|------|------|-------|
| Copy from source | 1 day/tier | 100 gp/tier | No |
| Learn from mentor | 1 day/tier | 100 gp/tier + quest | No |
| Research | 1 week/tier | 700 gp/week | INT (DC 8/12/16) to finalise |
| Backup own spell | 1 hr/tier | 50 gp/tier | No |

**Spellbook (blank, 20 capacity):** 200 gp

---

## Research Cost Examples

| Tier | Weeks | Base Cost | With Failures (est.) |
|-----:|------:|----------:|---------------------:|
| 1 | 1 | 700 gp | 800-1,000 gp |
| 2 | 2 | 1,400 gp | 1,600-2,000 gp |
| 3 | 3 | 2,100 gp | 2,500-3,000 gp |
| 4 | 4 | 2,800 gp | 3,500-4,500 gp |
| 5 | 5 | 3,500 gp | 5,000-7,000 gp |
| 6 | 6 | 4,200 gp | 6,000-8,500 gp |

---

## Design Notes

**Three paths, different trade-offs:**
- **Find it:** Cheapest and fastest, but requires adventure and luck
- **Mentor:** Mid-cost, but requires roleplay and earning trust
- **Research:** Most expensive and slowest, but always available

**Research is intentionally harsh:** Failure at the final check costs another week and 700 gp before you can try again. This encourages players to hunt for spells in the world rather than defaulting to research. The world is the better deal.

**The 100 gp/day principle:** Magic costs 100 gp per day of work. Copying takes days, so 100 gp/tier. Research takes weeks (7 days), so 700 gp/week. This makes costs easy to remember and calculate.

# Build-a-Spell

OSwR spells follow consistent patterns. Use this guide to create new spells, convert spells from other systems, or understand why existing spells work the way they do.

---

## Spell Tier Guidelines

Tiers represent power level and access. Higher tiers unlock at higher caster levels.

| Tier | Caster Level | Power Level |
|-----:|-------------:|-------------|
| 1 | 1 | Local, single-target, minor effects |
| 2 | 3 | Improved versions, small areas, useful utility |
| 3 | 5 | Battlefield control, serious damage, party buffs |
| 4 | 7 | Major transformations, large summons, teleportation |
| 5 | 9 | Permanent effects, raise dead, instant death (conditional) |
| 6 | 11 | World-altering, reshape reality, true resurrection |

---

## Effect Types by Tier

Use this table to determine what tier a spell should be based on what it does.

| Tier | Effect Types |
|-----:|--------------|
| 1 | Single-target buffs, minor healing (1d6+PB), detection, light/darkness, basic control (Sleep, Command), cantrip-level utility |
| 2 | Resistances, invisibility (single), levitation, illusions, hold person (humanoids only), ESP, locks/barriers |
| 3 | Flight, artillery damage (Level×d6), group invisibility, haste/slow, disease/blindness cure, protection radius effects |
| 4 | Polymorph, dimension door (short teleport), serious healing (PB×d6+PB), wall spells (2d6 damage), small summons, charm monster |
| 5 | Raise dead, teleport (long range), permanent walls, elementals (8 HD), mass effects, conditional instant death, contact other planes |
| 6 | Full heal/restoration, disintegrate, geas, weather control, reincarnation, limb regeneration, reality-altering effects |

**Using this table:** If you're converting or creating a spell, find the effect type that best matches. That's your starting tier. Then adjust based on:
- **Limitations** (touch only, concentration, rare components) → might lower tier
- **Power creep** (better than existing spells at that tier) → raise tier
- **Niche utility** (very situational) → might lower tier

---

## Scaling Patterns

OSwR spells use three distinct scaling patterns depending on spell type. This creates variety while keeping the system coherent.

---

### Artillery Spells (Area Damage)

**Formula: Caster Level × d6, save for half**

The big damage spells scale with caster level (not total character level), following OSR tradition. A Fighter 5/Magic-User 5 casts Fireball as a 5th-level caster, not 10th. The constraint isn't damage - it's slot availability. A level 5 caster has ONE Tier 3 slot. Fireball is their big gun, and it should feel like it.

| Level | Damage | Average |
|------:|-------:|--------:|
| 5 | 5d6 | 17.5 |
| 8 | 8d6 | 28 |
| 10 | 10d6 | 35 |
| 12 | 12d6 | 42 |

**Examples:** Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Call Lightning, Ice Storm

**Boost/Upcast:** +1d6 damage

---

### Missile Spells (Auto-Hit)

**Formula: PB missiles, each dealing 1d4+1**

Missile spells scale with Proficiency Bonus, providing reliable but modest damage. These are the "I don't want to waste a Fireball on this" option - always useful, never dominant.

| Level | PB Missiles | Damage per Missile | Total Average |
|------:|:-----------:|:------------------:|--------------:|
| 1-4 | 2 | 1d4+1 | 7 |
| 5-8 | 3 | 1d4+1 | 10.5 |
| 9-12 | 4 | 1d4+1 | 14 |

**Examples:** Magic Missile

**Boost/Upcast:** +1 missile

---

### Healing Spells

OSwR uses two core healing spells that scale naturally, plus a party heal at higher tiers.

| Spell | Tier | Formula | Level 7 (PB +3) | Level 9 (PB +4) |
|-------|-----:|---------|----------------:|----------------:|
| Cure Light Wounds | 1 | 1d6 + PB | 1d6+3 (6.5) | 1d6+4 (7.5) |
| Cure Serious Wounds | 4 | PB×d6 + PB | 3d6+3 (13.5) | 4d6+4 (18) |
| Mass Cure Wounds | 5 | 1d6 + PB (×PB targets) | 3 targets × 6.5 | 4 targets × 7.5 |

**Cure Light Wounds** is the workhorse - always useful, scales slowly with PB.

**Cure Serious Wounds** is the big single-target heal. The PB×d6 + PB formula means it grows significantly as you level, replacing the need for a separate "Cure Critical Wounds" spell.

**Mass Cure Wounds** heals the whole party at once - less per person than Cure Serious, but invaluable after a tough fight.

**Boost/Upcast:** +1 die (same size as base) or +1 target (Mass Cure)

---

### Other Damage Spells

Not every damage spell fits the artillery pattern. Single-target damage, damage-over-time, and wall spells use fixed dice appropriate to their tier.

**Damage-over-time:** Spells like Insect Plague (2d6/round) do less per instance but accumulate. Consider total potential damage over the spell's duration.

**Wall spells:** Deal damage on contact/crossing. Lower per-hit damage (2d6 at T4, 4d6 at T5, 6d6 at T6) but persistent and tactical.

**Single-target damage:** Often uses fixed dice with a save, or trades damage for a rider effect (prone, restrained, etc.).

---


## Duration Guidelines

| Duration | Typical Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Instant | Damage, healing, teleportation |
| 1 round | Single-action control (Command) |
| 1 Turn (10 min) | Combat buffs, exploration utility |
| 1 hour | Extended utility (Darkvision, Water Breathing) |
| Concentration | Ongoing effects requiring attention |
| Permanent | Terrain changes, walls, transformations |
| Until dispelled/broken | Charms, invisibility, curses |

**Lower tiers** tend toward 1 Turn or instant.
**Higher tiers** gain permanent effects and "until completed" durations.

---

## Range Categories

| Range | Distance | Typical Use |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Touch | Adjacent | Healing, buffs, personal enhancement |
| Self | Caster only | Detection, personal buffs |
| Near | 30 ft | Most combat spells, control |
| Far | 120 ft | Artillery (Fireball), long-range utility |
| Sight | Line of sight | Weather control, divination |

Most spells use **Near (30 ft)** or **Touch**. Reserve **Far** for spells meant to be used at range (artillery, scouting).

---

## Save Guidelines

| Save Type | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| **None (auto-hit)** | Low damage, utility effects (Magic Missile, Light) |
| **Save negates** | Control effects (Hold Person, Charm, Sleep*) |
| **Save for half** | Damage effects (Fireball, Lightning Bolt) |
| **Save or worse** | Devastating effects with partial mitigation |

*Sleep is notable for having no save but being limited by HD total.

**Which ability?**
- **DEX:** Dodgeable effects (explosions, projectiles, area effects)
- **CON:** Endurance effects (poison, disease, exhaustion, fire damage)
- **WIS:** Mental effects (charm, fear, compulsion, illusion)
- **INT:** Rarely used; intellectual trickery, complex illusions

**Standard DC:** Most spell saves are DC 12 (Normal difficulty).

---

## Area Effect Guidelines

| Area | Size | Examples |
|------|------|----------|
| Single target | 1 creature/object | Most T1-2 spells |
| Small | 10-15 ft radius | Silence, Protection from Evil (radius) |
| Medium | 20 ft radius | Fireball, Entangle, Ice Storm |
| Large | 30-40 ft radius | Cloudkill, Insect Plague, Earthquake |
| Line | 60 ft long, 5 ft wide | Lightning Bolt |
| Cone | Near range | Detection spells |
| Wall | 20-60 ft long | Wall of Fire, Blade Barrier |

Higher tiers can affect larger areas or more targets.

---

## The Boost System

Every spell has a **Boost** effect triggered by spending a Boost Die. Boosts should be meaningful but not game-breaking.

**Standard Boost Types:**

| Boost Type | Effect | Examples |
|------------|--------|----------|
| +1 target | Affect one additional creature/object | Hold Person, Cure Light Wounds |
| +1 duration | Add 1 Turn to duration | Most utility spells |
| +1d4 or +1d6 | Increase effect by one die | Healing, damage spells |
| Expand area | Increase radius by 5-10 ft | Fireball, Entangle |
| **Setback** on save | Target rolls with **Setback** | Charm, control spells |

**Boost Guidelines:**
- A boost should feel worth a Boost Die but not double the spell's power
- Duration boosts work well for utility spells
- Damage/healing boosts should add roughly 25-50% more effect
- Control spells benefit from +1 target or **Setback** on save
- Area expansion should be modest (5-10 ft)

---

## The Ritual Tag

Spells marked **{Ritual}** can be cast without preparing them first, but take 10 extra minutes and still consume a slot.

**Which spells get {Ritual}?**
- Detection spells (Detect Magic, Detect Evil, Find Traps)
- Communication spells (Speak with Animals, Speak with Plants)
- Divination spells (Commune, Commune with Nature)
- Utility that benefits from flexibility (Read Magic, Read Languages)

**Which spells DON'T get {Ritual}?**
- Combat spells (damage, control)
- Healing spells
- Buffs with combat application
- Anything time-sensitive

**The principle:** Rituals are for exploration and information-gathering, not combat power.

---

## Class Spell List Guidelines

Each class has a distinct magical identity:

**Cleric (Hallowed):**
- Healing and restoration
- Protection and warding
- Undead interaction (Turn, Speak with Dead)
- Divine communication

**Cleric (Druidic):**
- Nature communication (animals, plants)
- Weather and terrain control
- Animal enhancement and summoning
- Fire as purifying/natural force

**Magic-User:**
- Direct damage (arcane artillery)
- Illusion and deception
- Transformation (polymorph, transmutation)
- Knowledge and divination
- Summoning and binding

**Overlap:** Some spells appear on multiple lists (Detect Magic, Protection from Evil, Light). These are "universal" magical effects.

---

## Converting Spells from Other Systems

### From 5e
- **Spell level ≈ Tier** (5e level 1-2 = T1, level 3-4 = T2, etc.)
- Convert advantage/disadvantage to **Edge**/**Setback**
- Remove concentration if effect is simple; keep for ongoing control
- Reduce damage slightly (OSwR is lower-powered)
- Add a Boost effect

### From OSE/B/X
- **Spell level = Tier** (direct mapping)
- Add a Boost effect
- Clarify saves using ability scores (not "save vs spells")
- Standardise range to Touch/Near/Far
- Check duration against OSwR conventions (1 Turn = 10 min)

### From Other Systems
1. Identify the spell's core effect
2. Compare to existing OSwR spells of similar power
3. Assign tier based on comparable effects
4. Standardise format (Casting Time, Range, Duration, Effect, Boost)
5. Add {Ritual} if appropriate

---

## Spell Design Checklist

When creating or converting a spell:

- [ ] **Tier appropriate?** Compare to existing spells at that tier
- [ ] **Damage within guidelines?** Check against the damage table
- [ ] **Save makes sense?** DEX for dodging, CON for endurance, WIS for mental
- [ ] **Duration reasonable?** 1 Turn for most, longer for utility
- [ ] **Range appropriate?** Touch/Near/Far based on use case
- [ ] **Boost meaningful?** Worth a die but not overpowered
- [ ] **Ritual tag?** Only for non-combat utility
- [ ] **Fits class identity?** Cleric = divine, Magic-User = arcane, Druid = nature

---

## Example: Building a New Spell

**Concept:** A Tier 2 Magic-User spell that creates a slippery surface.

**Step 1 - Compare to tier:** Tier 2 has Web (control, 20-ft cube, DEX save or Speed 0). Similar power level.

**Step 2 - Set parameters:**
- Casting Time: 1 Action (standard)
- Range: Near (30 ft) - typical for control
- Duration: 1 Turn (10 min) - matches Web
- Area: 20 ft square (comparable to Web's cube)

**Step 3 - Define effect:**
- Control spell, so save negates
- DEX save (dodging/balance)
- Effect: difficult terrain + fall prone on failed save

**Step 4 - Add Boost:**
- +1 area or **Setback** on save? Area expansion feels right for terrain control.

**Result:**

### Grease
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Near (30 ft)
- **Duration:** 1 Turn (10 minutes)
- **Effect:** 20-ft square becomes slippery. Creatures entering or starting turn there DEX save (12) or fall prone. Area is difficult terrain.
- **Boost:** Expand to 30-ft square.

### Next Session: Tier 3-6 Editorial Pass

**HOW TO CONTINUE THIS WORK:**

⚠️ **CRITICAL: This is a collaborative 2-way review, NOT a bulk edit task.**

DO NOT read the file and start making changes. Instead:
1. Present each spell with your observations and suggestions
2. WAIT for Damien to respond with approval, modifications, or rejection
3. Only then make the agreed edits
4. Damien may disagree, offer alternative approaches, or ask questions - that's the point

This process caught important design issues in Tier 2 (Heat Metal armour rules, Warp Wood save logic) that would have been missed in a bulk pass.

**Process for each tier:**
1. Read the tier file (tier-3-spells.md, etc.)
2. Read BFRPG reference at `D:\Downloads\bfrpg spells.txt` for comparison
3. Go through each spell, presenting suggestions for Damien to approve/modify/reject
4. Make edits only after agreement
5. Update this status section when complete

**Patterns established (apply consistently):**
- **Saves:** Use "WIS/DEX/CON spell save" (not fixed DC 12). Exception: physical checks like Heat Metal's STR check use "DC 12"
- **Rituals:** Format as "1 Action or Ritual" in Casting Time. Detection, communication, and divination spells get ritual tag
- **Duration scaling:** Detection/protection/communication spells → "PB Turns". Pure utility (Light) → "1 hour". Combat spells → "1 Turn"
- **Movement:** Use 15 ft increments to match movement ranges
- **Area sizes:** Use 15-ft cube/sphere to match movement (not 20-ft)
- **Boosts:** Follow standard patterns (+1 die, +1 target, +1 Turn duration, range extends)
- **Repeat saves:** Control spells (Hold Person, Web) should allow repeat saves each round
- **Narrative first:** When saves feel wrong mechanically, ask "what's actually happening?" (e.g., Warp Wood targets object not person → no save; Heat Metal burns you regardless of willpower → STR to tear off, not CON to resist)

**Completed tiers:**
- [x] Tier 1 spells - full editorial pass (spell saves, ritual format, PB scaling)
- [x] Tier 2 spells - full editorial pass (Heat Metal/Warp Wood redesign, Know Alignment removed)
- [x] Tier 3 spells - full editorial pass (Hold Animal, Summon Swarm added for Druid)
- [x] Tier 4 spells - full editorial pass (Animate Dead, Dispel Magic, Divination added for Cleric)
- [x] Tier 5 spells - full editorial pass (Flame Strike added for Cleric)
- [x] Tier 6 spells - full editorial pass (Regenerate, Restoration added for Cleric)

**Other issues to review:**
- [ ] Continual Light (T2 Magic-User, T3 Cleric) - should these match?
- [ ] Ensure all boosts follow standard patterns

---

## Design Notes

**Why three scaling patterns?**

Different spell types serve different purposes. Artillery spells are your big moment - they should scale dramatically with level because you're spending a precious high-tier slot. Missile spells are reliable workhorses - they scale with PB to stay useful without ever dominating. Healing needs to keep pace but not outstrip damage - the +PB formula achieves this elegantly.

**Why Level × d6 for artillery?**

This follows OSR tradition. In classic D&D, Fireball dealt 1d6 per caster level. The limiting factor was never damage - it was the fact that you could only cast it once or twice per day. OSwR keeps this philosophy: when you finally get to throw that Fireball, it should feel devastating.

**Why PB for missiles and healing?**

PB scales more slowly than level (only +1 every four levels). This keeps Magic Missile and healing useful at high levels without making them the default choice. A level 10 Magic-User's 4 missiles (4d4+4) are nice, but they're not competing with 10d6 Fireball.

**Why +PB instead of more dice for healing?**

Healing that scales too fast trivialises damage. The +PB formula means a level 12 Cleric's Cure Light Wounds heals 1d4+4 (avg 6.5) - helpful, but not enough to fully recover from a serious hit. You need the higher-tier heals for that.

**Why Boost Dice for spells?**

Boost effects give casters meaningful choices without adding spell slot complexity. A Cleric deciding whether to boost Cure Light Wounds or save the die for later creates the same resource tension Fighters feel with their extra attacks.

# Time and Movement

How long things take and how far you can go.

---

## Time Segments

| Segment | Duration | Use |
|---------|----------|-----|
| **Round** | 6 seconds | Combat actions |
| **Turn** | 10 minutes | Dungeon exploration |
| **Watch** | 6 hours | Wilderness travel, marching, or rest (4 watches = 1 day) |
| **Day** | 24 hours | Downtime, recovery, overland travel |

---

## Movement

| Speed | Per Round | Per Turn (dungeon) | Per Watch (wilderness) |
|-------|----------:|-------------------:|------------------------:|
| **Slow** | 15 ft | 45 yards | 4.5 miles |
| **Normal** | 30 ft | 90 yards | 9 miles |
| **Fast** | 45 ft | 135 yards | 13.5 miles |

- **Slow:** Cautious, sneaking, or encumbered.
- **Normal:** Average traveling pace.
- **Fast:** Urgent or reckless movement.

**Dash:** In combat, you can use your action to Dash—move again at your full Speed. See [Combat Actions](combat#combat-actions).

**Turn speed** (dungeon) = 3× base speed in yards. Assumes cautious exploration — watching footing, checking for danger, mapping.

**Watch speed** (wilderness) = distance covered in 6 hours of marching with gear. Two watches is the safe daily maximum—pushing beyond risks [Fatigue](rests-recovery-fatigue). See [Wilderness Exploration](../refereeing/wilderness-exploration) for terrain modifiers and forced march rules.

---

## Light Sources

| Source | Duration | Radius |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Torch** | 6 Turns (1 hour) | 30 ft bright, 30 ft dim |
| **Lantern** | 6 hours (1 flask of oil) | 30 ft bright, 30 ft dim |
| **Candle** | 1 hour | 5 ft bright, 5 ft dim |

**Darkvision:** See 30 ft in dim light as if bright, darkness as dim. No color, no fine detail.

**No light:** Effectively blind. **Setback** on all rolls. Movement halved.

---

## Ranges

| Range | Distance | Use |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **Close** | Within 5 ft | Melee striking distance, whisper |
| **Near** | Within 30 ft | All ranged weapons, normal voice |
| **Far** | 30–120 ft | Powerful ranged weapons, shout |
| **Very Far** | Beyond 120 ft | Out of striking range, often out of sight |

---

## Climbing, Swimming, Crawling

Movement is reduced by one step (**Fast** → **Normal**, **Normal** → **Slow**) unless the creature has a climbing or swimming speed.

- **Slippery or difficult surfaces:** STR check, DC set by conditions.
- **Rough water:** STR check to make progress. Failure = 1 [Fatigue](rests-recovery-fatigue) and no forward movement that round.

---

## Jumping

**Long Jump:** 10 + STR feet (with 10 ft run-up). Standing long jump = half that.

**High Jump:** 3 + STR feet (with 10 ft run-up). Standing high jump = half that.

*Remember: STR is your ability value (−4 to +4), not a traditional ability score.*

Difficult landings or obstacles may require a STR or DEX check.

---

## Falling

Take **1d6 cumulative damage** for every 10 ft fallen. Land **Prone**.

- 10 ft = 1d6
- 20 ft = 1d6 + 2d6 = 3d6
- 30 ft = 1d6 + 2d6 + 3d6 = 6d6

---

## Suffocation

A creature can hold its breath for **1 + CON** minutes (minimum 30 seconds).

When out of breath, survive for **CON** rounds (minimum 1). At the start of the next turn after that, drop to 0 HP and begin dying. Cannot be stabilized until breathing again.

*CON is your ability value (−4 to +4). A character with CON +2 holds their breath for 3 minutes.*

# Rests, Recovery & Fatigue

Adventuring is exhausting. Here's how you push through—and what happens when you can't.

---

## Fatigue

Fatigue tracks exhaustion. You start at 0 and gain levels when pushed beyond your limits. Each level stacks—Fatigue 3 means −3 to all your checks and saves.

| Level | Effect |
|------:|--------|
| 1 | −1 to all checks and saves |
| 2 | −2 to all checks and saves |
| 3 | −3 to all checks and saves; Speed drops to **Slow** |
| 4 | −4 to all checks and saves; Speed remains **Slow** |
| 5 | **Incapacitated**—can't act until you rest |

### Gaining Fatigue

When you're pushed beyond your limits, roll **CON save (DC 12)**. On a failure, gain +1 Fatigue.

**Common triggers:**
- Forced march (extra **Watch** of travel)
- Skipping rest in a dungeon (after 6 **Turns** without resting)
- Dropping to 0 HP and getting back up
- Sleeping in heavy armor
- No food or water
- Soaked and cold, or blazing heat
- Long swims or climbs in armor
- Toxic fumes or bad air

Extreme conditions use DC 16. Proper gear or shelter gives **Edge**. Severe conditions give **Setback**.

---

## Breather (10 minutes)

After a fight or hard exertion, you can catch your breath. Spend 1 **Supply** and choose one:

- **Heal:** Regain **1d4 + CON** HP.
- **Shake it off:** Roll CON save (DC 12) to remove 1 Fatigue.

If an ally spends the Breather tending to you, you can do both.

*In a dungeon, resting for a **Turn** counts as a **Breather**. This is also how you avoid **Fatigue** from extended exploration—rest for a **Turn** every hour or so.*

---

## Night's Rest (8 hours)

A full night of sleep in reasonable conditions.

**Healing:** Spend any number of your Hit Dice. For each die spent, roll it and add CON to the result. Regain that many HP.

*You have Hit Dice equal to your level—one per level, using the die size for each class you have levels in. Spent Hit Dice don't return until you reach a Safe Haven. This is a key resource: you can keep adventuring as long as you have Hit Dice to spend, but eventually you'll need to return to safety.*

**Magic:** Regain all spell slots. You may change prepared spells.

**Fatigue:** Remove 2 levels if you have food and shelter. Remove 1 if you're roughing it.

*Shelter means protection from the elements. A tent or building counts. A bedroll under clear skies counts. A bedroll in a storm doesn't.*

---

## Safe Haven (1d4+1 days)

Extended rest in a safe, comfortable location—a town, friendly keep, or secure camp far from danger.

- **Full reset:** All HP, Hit Dice, spell slots, and Fatigue restored.
- **Downtime:** Time to train, research, craft, or pursue other activities.

The variable duration matters. You can't plan exactly when you'll be ready—roll when you arrive, not when you want to leave. Sometimes the dungeon won't wait. Factions move, rivals act, opportunities close. Going back to town has consequences beyond just healing.

---

## Why This System?

OSwR's three-tier rest system creates a different rhythm than 5e's short/long rest model.

**Breathers let you push on.** Even with low HP, you can patch yourself up after a fight and keep going. You're not forced to retreat after every encounter—but each Breather costs Supply, and Supply runs out.

**Night's Rest costs Hit Dice.** You can heal overnight, but you're spending a limited resource. A Fighter can keep burning through Hit Dice for several days of hard adventuring—but eventually they run dry. This creates natural pressure to return to safety without arbitrary limits on "adventuring days."

**Safe Haven takes time.** Going back to town isn't free. The 1d4+1 days means uncertainty—you might be ready in 2 days, or it might take 5. Meanwhile, the dungeon doesn't pause. This makes the choice to retreat meaningful: you're trading progress for recovery, and you don't know exactly how much time you're losing.

**Fatigue adds stakes.** You get progressively worse at everything as exhaustion builds. It's pressure that accumulates, not a sudden death spiral. And because it clears slowly (1-2 levels per night), it rewards careful resource management over reckless pushing. At Fatigue 5 you're incapacitated—and if you're dying, Fatigue makes your death rolls worse (see [Death & Dying](combat#death--dying)).

# Combat

Here's how fights work.

---

## Combat Order

1. **First contact:** Each hero rolls d20 + DEX vs DC 12. Pass = you go first.
2. **Heroes who passed** declare actions, roll, and resolve.
3. **All enemies** declare and resolve.
4. **All heroes** declare and resolve.
5. Repeat steps 3–4 until combat ends.

**On your turn:** Move up to your Speed and take one Action.

**Why declare first?** Everyone on a side says what they're doing before any dice are rolled. This means actions happen simultaneously — no waiting to see if an ally kills a target before you commit. It keeps combat fast and rewards coordination.

---

## Attacks & Damage

Roll d20 + ability + PB. Meet or beat the target's AC and you hit.

- **Melee:** Add STR to attack and damage rolls.
- **Ranged:** Add DEX to attack rolls only (no damage bonus).
- **Finesse weapons:** Use DEX for both attack and damage instead of STR.

**Hit:** Roll your weapon's damage dice + ability (for melee/finesse). Subtract from their HP.

**Critical Hit:** Natural 20 doubles your damage dice (not your ability).

**Miss:** No damage.

**Fumble:** Natural 1 invites a complication—dropped weapon, slipped footing, friendly fire. Referee's call.

**Cover:**
- *Partial cover* (half-hidden): Attacker has **Setback**.
- *Full cover* (completely obscured): Can't be targeted.

---

## Saving Throws

Roll d20 + ability vs the DC. Meet or beat it and you avoid or reduce the harm. Fail and you take the full effect.

You add PB to saves your class grants proficiency in. Don't forget to apply your Fatigue penalty (your exhaustion level—see [Rests](#rests-recovery-fatigue)).

---

## Death & Dying

At 0 HP, you're dying. Each round, roll 2d6 minus your Fatigue.

| Roll | What happens |
|------|--------------|
| 11+ | You're back up with HP equal to CON or one Hit Die roll (minimum 1) |
| 10 | Stable—you wake next turn at 1 HP |
| 5–9 | Still dying—roll again next round |
| 4 | Dead, but you get one heroic action before you fall |
| 3– | Dead outright |

**Getting back up:** When you recover from 0 HP, make a CON save (DC 12) or gain 1 [Fatigue](rests-recovery-fatigue). Getting knocked out takes a toll.

---

## Combat Actions

On your turn you can move up to your Speed and take one Action.

| Action | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Attack** | Melee or ranged attack vs AC |
| **Cast Spell** | Resolve per the spell description |
| **Dodge** | Attacks against you have **Setback** until your next turn |
| **Disengage** | Move without provoking opportunity attacks. You can Dash afterwards to flee |
| **Dash** | Double your movement this turn |
| **Help** | Give an ally **Edge** on their next roll (must be in reach) |
| **Grapple** | STR vs their STR or DEX—success means their Speed drops to 0 |
| **Shove** | STR vs their STR or DEX—push them 5 ft or knock them **Prone** |
| **Disarm** | STR or DEX vs theirs—weapon flies d10 ft in a random direction |
| **Hide** | DEX check, needs cover or distraction |
| **Stabilize** | Costs 1 **Supply**—dying ally becomes stable, wakes at 1 HP next turn |
| **Ready** | Name a trigger—when it happens, take your prepared action |
| **Improvise** | Describe something creative, roll vs DC, see what happens |

**Free actions:** You can do minor things alongside your move and action—draw a weapon, open a door, shout a warning, drink a potion.

---

## Opportunity Attacks

When a foe leaves your reach, you can make one free attack against them. This doesn't use up your turn.

**You can't make an opportunity attack if:**
- The foe Disengaged before moving
- You're already in melee with another creature

You can only make one opportunity attack per round.

---

Combat ends when all foes flee, surrender, or fall.

# Exploration Basics

Adventuring isn't just combat. Much of your time will be spent exploring dangerous places, managing resources, and making decisions about how to proceed.

---

## Time in the Dungeon

Underground, time is tracked in **Turns** (about 10 minutes each).

In a Turn, you can:
- Move cautiously through **1–2 rooms** (checking corners, mapping, watching for danger)
- **Or** search a single room thoroughly
- **Or** force open a stuck door, pick a lock, or similar focused task

**Rushing:** You can cover more ground by moving quickly, but you'll miss hidden dangers and can't map properly.

### What the Referee Tracks

Each Turn, the Referee rolls dice to see if something happens—an encounter, a warning sign, a light source guttering out, or the creeping onset of [Fatigue](rests-recovery-fatigue). The more Turns you spend, the more rolls. The dungeon doesn't wait for you.

**This means:**
- Every action costs time, and time costs rolls
- Searching everywhere is thorough but dangerous
- Sometimes the smart play is to move on

### What Affects Your Chances

**Noise.** Combat, shouting, bashing doors, clanking armor—all increase the chance something hears you. A quiet party is a safer party.

**Light.** Your torch is a beacon. Monsters in the dark see you coming long before you see them. But without light, you're blind.

**Lingering.** The longer you stay in one area, the more likely something finds you. Clear a room and move on, or accept the risk.

**Rest.** After about an hour (6 **Turns**) of exploration, you need to stop and rest for a **Turn** or risk [Fatigue](rests-recovery-fatigue). Pushing through exhaustion gets people killed.

---

## Time in the Wilderness

Overland, time is tracked in **Watches** (about 6 hours each). Four **Watches** make a day.

A typical day:
- **Two watches of travel** — the safe maximum
- **One watch for camp** — hunting, foraging, setting up
- **One watch for sleep** — you need it

### What the Referee Tracks

Each **Watch** of travel (and each night), the Referee rolls to see what happens—encounters, signs of danger, weather shifts, or supply problems. More travel means more rolls.

**Supplies matter.** Track your **Supply**. Running out in the wild is dangerous—you can't just pop back to town.

**Weather matters.** Storms slow travel. Extreme conditions can kill. The Referee will tell you when conditions change, but you should plan for the worst.

**Navigation matters.** In unfamiliar terrain without clear landmarks, you might get lost. Slow travel is safer travel.

---

## What You Should Know

**Ask questions.** "What do we see?" "Is there another way around?" "How far is the noise?" "Does this room have other exits?" Information keeps you alive.

**Manage your resources.** Light, food, water, rest—these aren't flavor, they're survival. Plan for them.

**Time has consequences.** Every **Turn** in the dungeon, every **Watch** in the wilderness, the Referee rolls dice. The longer you spend in dangerous places, the more likely something finds you.

**Your choices matter.** Do you search this room thoroughly (1 **Turn**, more rolls) or move on? Do you take the quick route through unknown territory or the longer safe path? Do you rest now or push on and risk **Fatigue**?

---

## The Takeaway

The Referee handles the procedures, but you control the risk. Every choice you make—how fast to move, how thoroughly to search, how much noise to make—affects your chances.

- Noise attracts attention
- Light reveals you to the darkness
- Time spent = rolls made = risk accumulated
- Rest is necessary, not optional

Play smart. Ask questions. Move with purpose.

# Hiring Help

Dungeons are deadly. Smart adventurers bring backup.

---

## Why Hire?

- **Carry loot** — more hands means more treasure
- **Hold torches** — someone needs to light the way
- **Watch the rear** — ambushes happen
- **Fight alongside you** — extra swords matter when HP is low
- **Replace the fallen** — if your character dies, a loyal retainer might step up

---

## Who Can You Hire?

**Retainers** are the most common hirelings:
- Commoners, mercenaries, would-be adventurers
- Found in taverns, guilds, or through notices
- Expect payment (2–5 gp/day) plus a share of treasure

**Specialists** handle specific jobs:
- Torchbearers (cheap, fragile)
- Porters (carry gear, won't fight)
- Men-at-arms (trained fighters, cost more)
- Guides (know the terrain)

---

## How Many?

Your **Charisma** determines how many retainers will follow you:

**Maximum retainers = PB + CHA** (minimum 0)

High Charisma means more followers and better loyalty. Low Charisma means they're harder to keep.

---

## What Do They Expect?

- **Fair pay** — daily wages, paid on time
- **Fair share** — lower-level retainers want half a share; equals want a full share
- **Fair treatment** — don't use them as trap-finders or meat shields
- **Survival** — they'll leave if you get too many of them killed

Treat them well and they'll stay. Mistreat them and they'll desert — or worse.

---

## Loyalty & Morale

Retainers are not heroes. They have their own survival instincts.

**Loyalty** is how much they trust you. It starts neutral and changes based on how you treat them:

- **Builds loyalty:** Fair pay, bonus treasure, saving their life, giving them good gear
- **Damages loyalty:** Stingy pay, needless risk, using them as trap-finders, getting their friends killed

**Morale** is whether they hold in combat. When the fight turns ugly—allies falling, overwhelming odds—the Referee checks their morale. Loyal retainers hold longer. Mistreated ones break and run.

**The takeaway:** Treat them like valuable allies, not expendable resources, and they'll follow you into the dark. Treat them like meat shields, and they'll abandon you when you need them most.

---

# Carousing

Carousing lets adventurers convert gold directly into XP through nights of drinking, gambling, and revelry. It's a gold sink that rewards risk-taking and creates stories.

---

## The Rules

Spend a night drinking, gambling, and making merry in a settlement. Spend up to the settlement's maximum in gold. **Gain XP equal to gold spent.**

| Settlement | Maximum Spend |
|------------|---------------|
| Village | 100 gp |
| Town | 500 gp |
| City | 2,000 gp |

The next morning, make a **CON save (DC 12)**. On a failure, roll on the Mishap table.

You may carouse again the following night—if the mishaps haven't caught up with you.

---

## Mishaps (2d6)

| Roll | Result |
|-----:|--------|
| **2** | **Jailed.** You wake in a cell. Bail is 1d6 × 100 gp, or a favor for someone unsavory. Your weapons and armor are impounded until you pay. |
| **3** | **Enemy made.** Someone powerful now hates you. A guild leader, noble's son, or criminal boss. They'll remember your face. |
| **4** | **Gambling debt.** You owe 1d6 × 50 gp to someone who doesn't accept "no." They have friends. Payment due within the week. |
| **5** | **Robbed.** Lose half your remaining coin. Your purse was cut, or you were rolled in an alley. No idea who did it. |
| **6** | **Fined.** Property damage, public indecency, or disturbing the peace. Pay 2d6 × 10 gp or spend a night in the stocks. |
| **7** | **Brutal hangover.** **Setback** on all checks until you complete a full rest. You remember nothing useful. |
| **8** | **Embarrassing tattoo.** It's prominent. It's ugly. It might be offensive to someone. Removal costs 100 gp and hurts. |
| **9** | **Entangled.** You promised something. A favor, a job, your sword arm. Someone will collect. Work out the details with the Referee. |
| **10** | **Reputation shift.** Word spreads about your antics. When you meet new NPCs, the Referee rolls to see how they react—you now get +1 with rogues and lowlifes, −1 with respectable folk. Lasts until you do something to change it. |
| **11** | **New contact.** You hit it off with someone useful—a fence, smuggler, off-duty guard, or guild member. They owe you a small favor, or you owe them one. |
| **12** | **Windfall.** You won big, found something, or someone owes YOU. Gain 1d6 × 50 gp, a rumor leading to treasure, or a minor magic item (Referee's choice). |

---

## Party Carousing

When multiple characters carouse together, each makes their own CON save. Some might hold their drink while others spiral into disaster—just like a real night out.

The same mishap can hit multiple characters (everyone gets robbed), or different results can create intertwined stories (one character makes an enemy while another makes a new contact with the same person).

---

# Referee Principles

*These are our principles. The ultimate rule is simpler: if you're enjoying it and your players are enjoying it, you're doing it right.*

---

**Be the world.** You're not for the players or against them. You're the environment, the NPCs, the consequences. React honestly to what they do.

**Prep locations, situations, motivations.** That's all you need. Where things happen, what's going on there, and what the NPCs want. The players provide the action.

**Don't have a plot.** If you're protecting an NPC because you have plans for them, you've stopped being the world and started being an author. Let things play out.

**Let the world surprise you.** Use random tables - encounters, reactions, what they're doing. Discovering the world alongside your players is part of the fun.

**Telegraph danger.** The more dangerous something is, the more obvious it should be. Eight armored foes in formation tells players everything they need to know.

**Reward clever play.** When players think their way around a problem, let it work - no roll needed. If they're being smart but there's still risk, give them **Edge**.

**Give out Boost Dice.** Don't hoard them. They reset each session and won't break anything. Good ideas, playing up hindrances, making the table laugh - all worth a Boost Die.

**Make rulings from understanding.** When you know the motivations and the mechanics of the world, calls are easy. Ask yourself: what makes sense here?

**The world isn't finished.** It develops during play. The players shape it. Tell them this upfront - it sets the right expectations.

**Keep the rules in the background.** The rules support player ideas, they don't constrain them. "Do what you think is right, and we'll figure it out."

---

## Before Your First Session

Tell your players:

- *"The world isn't complete - it develops during play, and you will shape it."*
- *"Don't worry about your character sheet. Do what makes sense for your character and we'll figure out the rules."*
- *"I'm not here to tell a story. I'm here to see what happens."*

# Designer Commentary

This page explains the thinking behind OSwR's design decisions. It's here for playtesters and curious readers who want to understand *why* the rules work the way they do.

---

## The Purpose

I don't want to write another book.

That's not laziness - it's the point. OSwR is designed to be handed over. Every system in this book exists so you can create for it, not just consume it.

**Build-an-Ancestry** means you're not waiting for me to publish dark elves. **Build-a-Spell** means you're not stuck with my spell list. The combinatorial treasure tables mean you'll never need a "Magic Items Compendium."

The monster stat blocks follow a rigid format with maximum flexibility, so your creations look like mine. The spell tiers (1-6) give us a shared language. The DC pattern (Easy 8, Normal 12, Hard 16) means your content and mine are interchangeable.

Want to run a B/X module? Convert on the fly. Want to grab a 5e monster? The maths work. Want to share your dungeon with another OSwR table? They'll read it instantly.

This is why there are only four classes but robust feats and multiclassing. This is why the treasure tables teach you the grammar of magic items instead of listing 100 fixed entries. This is why everything has tiers, tags, and patterns.

The book is a toolkit. Use it to build your own game.

---

## The Core Vision

**"5e chassis, OSR soul."**

OSwR takes the mechanical foundation that modern players know (bounded accuracy, proficiency bonus, Edge/Setback) and pairs it with the play philosophy that makes old-school games sing (player skill over character builds, resource pressure, emergent narrative).

The goal: a game where 5e players feel mechanically at home but discover a completely different play experience.

---

## The Design Pillars

These are the principles behind every rule in OSwR.

### 1. Danger Stays Real

Combat is risky at every level. HP stays lower than 5e. Death has teeth - you can die, not just yo-yo back up. There are no safety nets that let you bounce back repeatedly. The power curve stays low even as characters advance.

### 2. Emergent Gameplay Through Systems

The world responds to player choices through dice, not GM decisions. Reaction rolls mean NPCs aren't pre-scripted. Morale means enemies flee. Supply means torches and rations create real decisions. These systems generate story - the GM doesn't decide "this NPC is friendly," the dice and player choices create that outcome.

### 3. Player Flexibility Without Bloat

Four classes. No skill list. Feats build archetypes - Ranger, Paladin, Bard, Monk all emerge from combinations. If it makes sense, roll for it. One rule that covers many cases beats many rules that cover one case each.

### 4. Resource Management Matters

Encumbrance is slot-based and consequential. Light matters - darkvision is rare. Rest has three tiers with real trade-offs. Spell slots are limited. Fatigue accumulates. 5e handwaves these; OSwR makes them real.

### 5. Functional With Flavour

Every rule separates what it *does* from what it *is*. Mechanics first, atmosphere second. Monster stat blocks have a mechanics line then a flavour line. Spells have effects then description. The book supports two reading modes: scan for rules, or read for immersion.

---

# Character Foundations

## Why Abilities (Not Scores + Modifiers)

In classic D&D and 5e, you roll 3d6 for a score (3-18), then look up a modifier (-4 to +4). OSwR skips the score entirely - you just record the modifier.

**Why?** The score is vestigial. In play, you only ever use the modifier. "I have 16 Strength" means nothing until converted to "+2" (5e) or "+2 to hit" (OSE). OSwR cuts the middleman.

**What about rolling?** You still roll 3d6 and use the table to find your ability. The process is identical - you just don't write down a number you'll never use again.

**Classic divergence:** OSE uses scores (3-18) with varying modifier scales. OSwR's unified -4 to +4 range is closer to 5e but simpler than both.

---

## Why Ancestry (Not Race)

Simple: "race" carries baggage. "Ancestry" describes what it actually is - where you come from, what you inherited.

**Mechanical change:** OSwR ancestries have 2–3 traits. Each ancestry has signature abilities (Dwarf stonecunning, Elf ghoul immunity, Halfling fearlessness), but these can vary for sub-ancestries.

**Classic divergence:** In OSE, demihuman races ARE classes. An Elf is a class, not an ancestry + class. OSwR separates these, allowing Dwarf Fighters, Elf Clerics, etc.

---

## Why Four Classes?

Classic D&D had fighters, magic-users, clerics, and thieves. OSwR has Fighter, Magic-User, Cleric, and Expert.

**Why not more?** Every additional class creates overlap, edge cases, and balance concerns. Four classes can cover any character concept when combined with backgrounds, feats, and multiclassing.

**Why "Expert" instead of "Thief"?** Thief implies criminality. Expert implies competence. A scout, diplomat, or artisan is an Expert. So is a thief. The name doesn't constrain the fiction.

---

## Why Experts Pick from Two Lists

Experts start with 6 feats and gain +1 at odd levels. But the Expert feat list only has ~19 options. By level 11, they'd run out of meaningful choices.

**The solution:** Experts can pick from Expert OR General feats. This fits their identity as generalists - versatile characters who dabble in everything. The larger combined pool (60+ feats) gives them real choices at every level.

**Why not just add more Expert feats?** That's padding. The Expert fantasy is "jack of all trades," not "has their own giant list." Letting them dip into General captures the archetype better than inventing narrow feats to fill a quota.

---

## Why Brawler Scales

Brawler grants unarmed damage that scales: 1d4 → 1d6 (level 5) → 1d8 (level 9).

**The problem it solves:** Without scaling, monk-style builds fall behind weapon users at higher levels. A Fighter with a longsword does 1d8 damage forever. An unarmed character stuck at 1d4 feels weak.

**Why not just use weapons?** Some players want unarmed builds. The system shouldn't punish that - it should make it viable without making it better than armed combat.

**Why in General, not Fighter?** Both Fighter monks (combat focus) and Expert monks (agility/skill focus) should be buildable. Putting Brawler in General enables both paths.

---

# Equipment & Resources

## Why Weapon Tags?

Weapon tags give players tactical options without adding cognitive load. The design principle: tags must be either **conditional triggers** (happens automatically when X occurs) or **simple trades** (sacrifice one thing, get another).

**Cleave** (Greataxe, Greatsword): When you drop a foe to 0 HP, deal d4 to an adjacent enemy. No decision needed - it just happens. Rewards aggressive play and makes two-handers feel powerful against groups.

**Crush** (Mace, Maul): Trade your STR damage to knock the target prone. Simple choice: damage or control? No save, no slowdown.

**Hook** (Flail, Poleaxe, Sickle): Trade your STR damage to push or pull 5 ft. Battlefield positioning for tactical players.

**What we cut:** Earlier drafts had Armor-Piercing, Quiet, Parry, Accurate, Ready. Each failed the "earns its place" test:
- *Armor-Piercing*: Became the +1 on crossbows and shortsword - the bonus IS the benefit
- *Quiet*: Situational flavor, not a combat choice. Daggers are obviously quiet
- *Parry/Accurate/Ready*: Added complexity without interesting decisions

**The +1 pattern:** Shortsword (d6+1), Light Crossbow (d6+1), Heavy Crossbow (d8+1) all have a flat +1 to damage. For crossbows, this represents armor-piercing power - you get more damage but Loading means you can't fire every round. For shortsword, it's the premium over the cheaper Sickle (which has Hook instead).

---

## Why Armor Works This Way?

**Three tiers, clear trade-offs:**
- **Leather (AC 12 + DEX)**: Full mobility, any DEX bonus
- **Chain (AC 14 + DEX max 2)**: Solid protection, some mobility
- **Plate (AC 18)**: Best protection, no DEX, Stealth **Setback**, Bulky, expensive

**Why AC 18 for Plate?** Earlier drafts had AC 16, but that made Chain + high DEX strictly better. A character with DEX +2 in Chain gets AC 16 - same as Plate, but cheaper, lighter, quieter, and faster to don.

At AC 18, Plate is definitively the highest AC in the game. You pay for it (300 gp, STR 12, Bulky slot, Stealth penalty, 10 min to don), but you get something Chain can't match. Chain + Shield (AC 17) is competitive for those who want a hand free.

**Shield Sunder:** When you take damage, you can destroy your shield to reduce that damage to 0. This is a meaningful defensive choice - spend your shield to survive a big hit. Shields are cheap (7 gp), so it's not about resource hoarding. It's about dramatic moments: "The ogre's club crashes down - you raise your shield, which explodes into splinters, but you're alive."

---

## Why Supply (Not Rations)?

OSwR uses "Supply" as an abstract resource rather than tracking individual rations, waterskins, and bandages.

**What Supply represents:** Food, water, basic medical supplies, and general consumables. One unit covers a day of sustenance or one use of healing/recovery.

**Why abstract?** Tracking 14 rations, 3 waterskins, and 6 torches is bookkeeping without decisions. Supply simplifies: you have X uses, spend them as needed. The decision is when to use them, not whether you remembered to buy the right type.

**Where it's spent:**
- Breathers (1 Supply to heal or shake off Fatigue)
- Stabilizing dying allies (1 Supply)
- Daily sustenance (on wilderness expeditions)

**Why not "Provisions"?** We changed the name. "Provisions" sounds like food only. "Supply" better captures the abstraction—it's whatever consumable the situation demands.

---

# Core Mechanics

## Why Edge/Setback (Not Advantage/Disadvantage)

5e's advantage system is elegant but binary: roll 2d20, take best/worst. You either have it or you don't, and multiple sources don't stack. That binary nature creates problems—if you have advantage from one source, additional advantages are worthless. Stacking circumstantial bonuses should *matter*.

**Edge and Setback use 1d6.** **Edge** adds 1d6 to your roll. **Setback** subtracts 1d6. They cancel one-for-one, but they also *stack*. Two sources of **Edge** means +2d6. Being really well-prepared matters more than being slightly prepared.

**Why d6?** It feels different from the core d20. Rolling a d6 alongside your d20 has a tactile, additive quality that 2d20-keep-best lacks. The language is natural too: "take an edge" makes intuitive sense at the table.

**Classic divergence:** OSE has no advantage system. OSwR uses **Edge**/**Setback** for situational modifiers that stack.

---

## Why Boost Dice?

Boost Dice started as physical d6s handed to players for doing cool things. The origin was simple: reward players at the table with something tangible they can immediately use.

**Reset each session.** You start with Boost Dice equal to your Proficiency Bonus. They don't carry over—use them or lose them. This encourages spending rather than hoarding.

**Natural 1 recovery.** When you roll a nat 1 on any d20, you gain 1 BD (up to your maximum). This creates a self-regulating economy—players who roll badly get more fuel, players who roll well don't need as much. It also softens the sting of critical failures without removing the failure itself. "I missed badly, but at least I got something."

**The Referee can give more.** Play up your hindrances? Boost Die. Do something memorable? Boost Die. But this is now a bonus on top of a functional baseline, not the primary source. The nat 1 recovery means the economy runs itself—taking pressure off the Referee to constantly hand out dice.

**Class-specific uses.** Each class spends Boost Dice differently:
- **Fighter:** Extra attack (aggressive, combat-focused)
- **Expert:** Roll 2d6 keep best (precision, reliability)
- **Cleric/Magic-User:** Trigger Boostable spell effects (resource multiplication)

**Why separate from Edge?** **Edge** is situational—the environment or circumstances give it to you. Boost Dice are earned through play and spent deliberately. They're a player resource, not a Referee ruling.

**Classic divergence:** This replaces 5e's Inspiration (which nobody remembers to use) with something visible, tactile, and tied to character identity.

**Why feats cost Boost Dice.** Some feats—Rage, Leadership, Hunter's Mark—let you do powerful things. But they cost Boost Dice to activate. This means you can't do everything: you can't Rage AND take an extra Fighter attack AND boost your damage roll in the same fight. You have to choose.

Hard decisions make a good game. Boost Dice create those decisions by putting powerful abilities in competition with each other.

---

## On Bounded Accuracy

OSwR uses the 5e principle of bounded accuracy: numbers stay small, bonuses don't inflate wildly with level, and a +1 always matters.

**Why keep it?** It works. Low-level threats remain relevant. High-level characters are powerful but not invincible. The maths are simple and the probability curves are intuitive.

**The trade-off:** Characters don't feel superheroic at high levels the way they do in 5e. That's intentional. OSwR is about dangerous adventures, not power fantasies.

---

## On The Four Tiers

OSwR roughly divides play into tiers:

| Tier | Levels | Play Style |
|------|--------|------------|
| Novice | 1-3 | Fragile, local, learning the world |
| Journeyman | 4-6 | Competent, regional, taking on serious threats |
| Veteran | 7-9 | Powerful, famous, shaping events |
| Name Level | 10-12 | Domain play, legacy, shaping the world |

This isn't explicit in the rules, but it's implicit in the pacing and costs. The game shifts as characters grow - from "survive the dungeon" to "what kind of lord will you be?"

---

## Why No Passive Checks?

5e has passive Perception (10 + modifier) for "always-on" awareness. We cut it.

**The problem:** Passive checks give the illusion of a system while the Referee is really just deciding. If your passive is 12 and the DC is 12, you notice. If the DC is 13, you don't. The Referee sets both numbers—they're deciding the outcome with extra steps.

**OSR philosophy:** If you don't say you're looking, you don't find it. Player engagement matters. "I search the room" should prompt description and decisions, not a number comparison.

**What replaces it:** Referee judgment. If the trap is obvious and the players are being careful, they notice. If it's hidden and they're rushing, they trigger it. If it's uncertain, call for a roll. No passive score needed.

---

# Combat

## Why Side-Based Initiative?

OSwR uses side-based combat with declare-then-resolve. This is inspired by Cairn and classic OSR games, not 5e's individual initiative.

**The flow:**
1. First contact: Each hero rolls d20 + DEX vs DC 12. Pass = act before enemies.
2. Heroes who passed declare actions, roll, and resolve.
3. All enemies declare and resolve.
4. All heroes declare and resolve.
5. Repeat steps 3–4 until combat ends.

**Why no individual initiative?** Rolling and tracking initiative for every combatant slows play without adding meaningful decisions. In 5e, initiative is often "roll high, act first, forget the number." Side-based combat removes that bookkeeping entirely.

**Why declare before rolling?** This is the key design choice. When everyone on a side declares their action before any dice are rolled, actions resolve simultaneously. You can't wait to see if the Fighter kills the goblin before deciding who to attack.

**What this enables:**
- **Faster play.** No initiative tracking, no "whose turn is it?"
- **Coordination matters.** "I'll hold the door while you grab the chest" requires trust—you're both committing.
- **No reactive optimization.** Players and enemies both commit before knowing outcomes. This matches the fiction of simultaneous combat better than sequential turns.

**The first-contact check.** The DEX check at the start determines whether you get a free swing before enemies act. Pass and your side gets a full action before any enemy moves. Fail and enemies go first—but then you join in with the other heroes. You don't "miss a turn"; the flow just starts with enemies instead of heroes.

**Classic divergence:** This matches Cairn's approach more than 5e's. OSE uses d6 group initiative (rerolled each round). OSwR's single first-contact check is simpler—one roll at the fight's start, then pure alternation.

## Why Opportunity Attacks Work This Way?

OSwR keeps opportunity attacks but adds a key restriction from the original OSwR: **you can't make an opportunity attack if you're already in melee with another creature.**

**The flow:**
- When a foe leaves your reach, you can make one free attack
- This doesn't use your turn—it's a bonus swing
- You can only make one opportunity attack per round

**The "engaged in melee" rule:**

This is the tactical piece. If the Fighter is toe-to-toe with an ogre, the Wizard can slip past that ogre without getting clubbed. The ogre is busy with the Fighter.

**Why this matters:**

1. **It's realistic.** If you're actively fighting someone, you can't also swing at someone walking past. Your attention is on the threat in front of you.

2. **Rewards positioning.** "I'll hold this one while you get past" becomes a real tactic. Fighters become battlefield controllers by engaging threats.

3. **Squishier characters can escape.** A Wizard with 4 HP shouldn't have to eat an opportunity attack just to reposition. If an ally is engaging the enemy, they're safe.

4. **Creates teamwork.** The rule naturally encourages coordination without requiring complex mechanics.

**One per round:** You get one opportunity attack per round, total. This prevents the "trigger five opportunity attacks by walking past five enemies" abuse while keeping the rule simple.

---

## Why Disengage Lets You Dash?

In OSwR, Disengage does two things: you move without provoking opportunity attacks, AND you can Dash afterwards.

**The problem being solved:** Characters should always be able to run from a fight. A Wizard with 4 HP facing an angry ogre needs an escape valve. If Disengage only prevents opportunity attacks but doesn't let you actually get away, you're still in reach next round.

**The solution:** Disengage + Dash as a single action. You safely extract AND create distance. This is the retreat option—use it when things go wrong.

**Why not make Dash a separate action?** Then retreating takes two turns (Disengage this turn, Dash next turn), during which the enemy can close the gap. The combined action makes retreat actually work.

**This is from the original OSwR.** The rule existed specifically to ensure players could always flee. Running away is cool—you get to fight another day. OSR play should reward knowing when to run.

---

## Why DEX Doesn't Add to Ranged Damage?

In OSwR, DEX adds to ranged attack rolls but NOT damage. Only melee (STR) and finesse (DEX choice) add ability to damage.

**The reasoning:**

1. **Range is already an advantage.** Archers attack from safety. Melee fighters take hits. The ranged character is already getting a benefit—they shouldn't also get bonus damage.

2. **Old-school feel.** Classic D&D didn't add DEX to ranged damage. A bow does its damage dice, period. The skill (DEX) helps you hit; the weapon does the hurting.

3. **Differentiation.** This makes the choice between ranged and melee meaningful. Want reliable damage? Get into melee with STR. Want safety? Stay back, but accept lower damage output.

4. **Finesse is the hybrid.** If you want DEX for damage, use a finesse weapon—but that means being in melee range. You're trading safety for the ability modifier.

**What this means in play:** A Fighter with STR +3 and a longsword does d8+3 damage. An Expert with DEX +3 and a shortbow does d6 damage (no bonus). The Fighter's damage is meaningfully higher, which compensates for the risk of being in melee.

**Future consideration:** A feat that adds DEX to ranged damage could work for dedicated archers (Fighter or Expert). This would be an opt-in specialisation rather than a default, preserving the base design while rewarding the archetype.

## Why Death & Dying Uses Fatigue?

5e's death saves are boring. Roll a d20, pass or fail, three strikes either way. There's no tension after the first roll—just waiting to see which side hits three first.

OSwR's death system uses 2d6 minus your Fatigue:

| Roll | What happens |
|------|--------------|
| 11+ | Back up with HP equal to CON or one Hit Die (your choice) |
| 10 | Stable—wake next turn at 1 HP |
| 5–9 | Still dying—roll again next round |
| 4 | Dead, but you get one heroic action first |
| 3– | Dead outright |

**Why this works:**

1. **Instant tension.** Every roll matters. You could die on your first death check—or heroically spring back up. No three-strike countdown.

2. **Fatigue integration.** The more battered you are, the harder it is to survive. A fresh character rolling 2d6 has good odds. A character at Fatigue 3 rolling 2d6−3? Much worse. This ties the death system to the rest of the game's attrition mechanics.

3. **The heroic death.** Rolling exactly 4 is rare, but it creates memorable moments. "You're dead, but you get one last action." That's the stuff stories are made of.

4. **Player choice on recovery.** When you roll 11+, you choose: CON (predictable) or Hit Die roll (potentially better, potentially worse). Even in recovery, there's a decision.

---

# Rests & Recovery

## Why Three Rest Types?

OSwR has Breathers, Night's Rest, and Safe Haven. Each serves a different purpose:

**Breather (10 minutes):** Quick recovery after a fight. Spend 1 Supply, choose to heal (1d4 + CON) OR shake off 1 Fatigue. If an ally helps you, you can do both. This creates decisions: heal HP or clear Fatigue? Help your friend or take your own Breather?

**Night's Rest (8 hours):** Spend Hit Dice to heal (roll + CON each), recover spell slots, remove 1-2 Fatigue depending on conditions. Hit Dice don't come back until Safe Haven—this is the key pressure point.

**Safe Haven (1d4+1 days):** Full reset. The variable duration matters: you can't plan exactly when you'll be ready. Sometimes the dungeon won't wait.

**Why not just Short/Long rest?** 5e's two-rest system encourages "adventuring day" pacing that doesn't fit dungeon crawling. Three tiers create more pressure: Breathers are quick but limited, Night's Rest costs Hit Dice you can't easily recover, and Safe Haven requires leaving the danger zone entirely.

---

## Why Fatigue Has Five Levels?

| Level | Effect |
|------:|--------|
| 1 | −1 to all checks and saves |
| 2 | −2 to all checks and saves |
| 3 | −3 to all checks and saves; Speed drops one step |
| 4 | −4 to all checks and saves; Speed drops to Slow |
| 5 | Incapacitated—can't act until you rest |

**Gradual pressure, not sudden death.** Fatigue accumulates from environmental stress (forced march, bad weather, sleeping in armor) and combat (dropping to 0 HP). The escalating penalties create tension without killing characters outright.

**Recovery is deliberate.** You can clear 1 Fatigue during a Breather (with a CON save), or 1-2 during Night's Rest depending on shelter. Full reset requires Safe Haven. This means Fatigue stacks up faster than it clears—exactly the pressure an OSR game needs.

---

## Why Dropping to 0 HP Causes Fatigue?

Getting knocked out should matter. In 5e, the optimal strategy is often to let allies drop, then heal them with 1 HP ("yo-yo healing"). There's no lasting consequence.

In OSwR, dropping to 0 HP triggers a CON save (DC 12) when you get back up—fail and you gain 1 Fatigue. This creates real stakes while still giving players some agency:

1. **Combat has lasting effects.** Even if you survive, you're weakened.
2. **Breather choices matter.** After a tough fight, do you heal HP or clear the Fatigue you just gained?
3. **Teamwork helps.** If an ally spends their Breather tending to you, you can do both.
4. **Attrition pressure.** Multiple knockdowns in a dungeon stack up, pushing parties toward retreat.

---

# Exploration

## Why 4-Hour Watches?

We use 4-hour watches (six per day) for wilderness exploration. Earlier drafts experimented with 6-hour watches (four per day), but we returned to the original design.

**Why 4-hour watches work better:**

1. **Hex alignment.** At Normal terrain speed, you cover 6 miles per watch — exactly one 6-mile hex. This clean 1:1 relationship makes hexcrawl navigation intuitive. "One watch, one hex" is easy to track and creates natural decision points.

2. **Meaningful choices.** Six watches per day gives players more granularity in how they spend their time. Travel three watches, hunt for two, rest for one. Or travel two, investigate a hex, forage, and rest two. The extra watches create more interesting daily planning.

3. **Activities scale properly.** Hunting takes two watches because tracking and killing game is serious work. Rest takes two watches because a proper night's sleep needs time. These durations feel right at 4 hours each — hunting is a half-day commitment, rest is a full night.

4. **Three travel watches is a full day.** At 4 hours each, three watches of travel is 12 hours of marching — an exhausting but realistic day's journey. Pushing to a fourth watch means forced march saves every hour.

**What we traded:** The simpler "four watches = four quarters of the day" mental model. But in practice, the hex alignment and activity granularity matter more than having a neat division of the day.

---

# Economy & Advancement

## Why 1 GP = 1 XP?

This is the classic OSR ratio, and it's not arbitrary.

**Emergent gameplay.** When treasure is the primary XP source, players pursue treasure. They sneak past the dragon because fighting is risky and the hoard is what matters. They negotiate with goblins because dead goblins don't lead to treasure rooms. The *system* rewards clever play - the Referee doesn't have to decide what counts as "clever."

**Player-driven.** With milestone or story XP, the Referee controls advancement. With treasure XP, the players control it. Find more treasure, level faster. The world contains the rewards; players decide how to get them.

**Module compatibility.** Decades of published adventures have treasure placed assuming 1 GP = 1 XP. OSwR can use those adventures unchanged.

---

## Why Monster XP = HD² × 10?

This creates a smooth curve where tougher monsters are worth significantly more, but treasure remains the primary XP source.

| HD | XP |
|---:|---:|
| 1 | 10 |
| 3 | 90 |
| 5 | 250 |
| 10 | 1,000 |

A goblin (HD 1) is worth 10 XP. A dragon (HD 10) is worth 1,000 XP. But the dragon's *hoard* might be worth 10,000+ XP. The maths reinforce the play philosophy: treasure matters more than kills.

---

## Why "Overcome" Instead of "Kill"?

Monster XP is earned when you "overcome" a threat - which includes defeating, outsmarting, driving off, or otherwise neutralising it.

**Combat is not the only solution.** Tricking the ogre into leaving, negotiating safe passage with the bandits, or locking the gelatinous cube in a room all count as overcoming the threat. The XP reward is the same.

**This matches the play philosophy.** If we only rewarded kills, players would fight everything. But OSwR wants players to think, negotiate, and avoid unnecessary risks. The XP rules support that.

---

## Why Feats Cost Gold?

In 5e, you level up and get your features automatically. In OSwR, levelling grants the *capacity* for new abilities - you must still pay gold and spend time to unlock them.

**The reasoning:**

1. **Gold sinks matter.** Without ways to spend treasure, gold piles up pointlessly. Training costs keep gold valuable at every level.

2. **Fiction follows.** Your Fighter didn't just wake up knowing Shield Master. They spent a week drilling, bought practice equipment, maybe hired a sparring partner. The gold represents that.

3. **Different classes, different pressures.** Magic-Users spend gold on spell research. Fighters spend it on feats. The system naturally creates different economic priorities without forcing it.

4. **Party dynamics.** Characters level at different rates based on how they spend gold. That's fine—it creates natural party roles and dependencies.

---

## Why Research Is Expensive?

Spell research costs 700 gp per week and requires an INT check at the end of the full research period to finalise the spell. Failure costs another week of work (700 gp) before you can attempt finalisation again.

**The world is the better deal.** Finding a scroll in a dungeon costs only the copying fee (100 gp/tier). Research is the fallback when you can't find what you need. This encourages exploration and rewards player resourcefulness.

**Magic-Users are powerful.** By tier 5-6, spells reshape reality. That power should be earned through adventure, not bought in a library. Research exists so wizards always have a path forward - but it shouldn't be the easy path.

---

## Why 100 gp/day for Magic?

Simple, memorable, scales naturally with time. A week of research = 7 days = 700 gp. No lookup tables needed.

This also makes finding spells in the world more valuable. Copying from a found scroll (100 gp/tier) is much cheaper than researching from scratch (700 gp/week + INT check). The economy rewards exploration.

---

## Why Spell Scaling Patterns?

OSwR spells follow predictable patterns:

- **Artillery** (Fireball, Lightning Bolt): Tier × d6 damage, save for half
- **Missile** (Magic Missile): PB missiles, each dealing 1d4+1
- **Healing** (Cure spells): Scales with PB and tier

When I converted classic spells, I couldn't see the logic in why some were higher level than others. The original spell levels felt arbitrary. Patterns fix that—you can look at a spell and understand why it's Tier 3 instead of Tier 4.

More importantly, patterns are creation tools. If someone writes a "Book of Shadow Magic," the spells will fit because the grammar is clear. If you convert a spell from B/X or 5e, you know where it belongs. The patterns make the system legible—to me, to you, to anyone creating for it.

---

## Why Carousing?

Carousing lets players convert gold directly to XP by spending it on revelry. This solves several problems:

1. **Gold accumulation.** Without spending, treasure becomes meaningless numbers. Carousing gives it somewhere to go.

2. **Different advancement strategies.** A Fighter who carouses and a Magic-User who saves for research will level at different rates. This is intentional—it creates party dynamics. The Fighter becomes a better bodyguard for the squishy wizard. Everyone benefits.

3. **Story generation.** The mishap table creates situations. Gambling debts, new enemies, embarrassing tattoos, unexpected windfalls. Carousing turns downtime into adventure hooks.

4. **The mishap curve.** The 2d6 table means hangover (7) is most common—roughly 17% of failed saves. The dramatic results (jail, windfalls) are rare but memorable. Most nights out end with a headache, not a crisis.

**Limits by settlement size.** You can only spend what the local economy can absorb. A village tavern can't handle 2,000 gp of revelry. This also encourages returning to larger towns—and creates reasons to explore the world.

---

## Why Pious Offerings?

It's the Cleric alternative to carousing. Fighters drink; Clerics pray. Same mechanical effect (gold → XP), different fiction.

Clerics who want to carouse still can—Pious Offerings is an option, not a requirement. But it gives divine characters a thematic way to convert wealth to advancement without rolling on the mishap table.

---

## Why Cleric Tithes?

Magic-Users pay for every spell - 100 gp to copy, 700+ gp to research. Clerics receive their spells through divine connection. Without an equivalent cost, Clerics would have a massive economic advantage.

**The solution:** Clerics must tithe 10% of all treasure to maintain divine favour. This creates a gold sink that scales with success and fits the fiction of divine service.

**Hallowed vs Druidic:** Hallowed Clerics give to their temple. Druidic Clerics return wealth to nature - offerings at sacred sites, releasing animals, burning sacrifices, feasting communities. Same mechanical effect, different fiction.

---

## Why Banking Has Fees?

Gold is heavy (100 coins = 1 slot). Players can't carry their wealth. Banking provides security but takes a cut—another gold sink that scales with success.

**The one-month rule:** Withdraw within a month, pay 10%. Leave it longer, withdraw free. This encourages adventuring over constant trips to the bank. Deposit your loot, go explore, come back when you need it.

---

## Why Temple Healing Costs Money?

Divine magic isn't free. Temple healing costs exist for several reasons:

1. **HP attrition stays meaningful.** If healing is cheap, damage doesn't matter—you just pay a few coins and you're fresh. Expensive healing means getting hurt has lasting consequences.

2. **Clerics in the party are valuable.** When temple healing costs 100+ gp, a Cleric who can heal for free is a major asset. This creates party composition incentives.

3. **Gold sink that scales.** Early characters might scrape together 100 gp for minor healing. High-level characters dropping 5,000 gp to raise the dead is still significant.

4. **Prevents the heal-and-return loop.** If adventurers could cheaply heal up and head straight back to the dungeon, the Safe Haven rest system loses its teeth. Expensive healing encourages proper recovery time.

**The pricing curve:** Base costs roughly follow Tier² × 100 gp (T1 = 100, T2 = 400, T3 = 900...), but we rounded to memorable numbers: 100, 200, 500, 1,000, 2,500, 5,000. The curve accelerates at higher tiers because world-altering magic *should* be expensive. Raising the dead at 2,500 gp is still a fortune for most parties; full restoration at 5,000 gp represents a major investment.

**Referees adjusting prices:** If you want stricter economics, the Tier² × 100 formula gives you a baseline. Double it for rare services or hostile temples. Halve it for faithful members or temples in the party's debt.

---

# Class-Specific Design

## Why Turn Undead Uses a Flat DC

Turn Undead requires a Normal (DC 12) WIS check. The power scales through HD thresholds, not DC increases.

**The design:**
- Affect up to 2d6 + PB Hit Dice of undead
- Destroy if HD ≤ level − 3
- Turn if HD ≤ level + 1
- No effect if HD > level + 1

**Why flat DC?** Simplicity. Players remember "DC 12" easily. The HD thresholds handle scaling - a level 1 Cleric can turn weak undead, a level 10 Cleric destroys them and turns stronger ones.

**Why level − 3 for destroy?** Destroying undead should feel earned. A level 1 Cleric shouldn't instantly vaporise skeletons. At level 4, they can destroy 1 HD undead. This creates a meaningful progression.

---

# Referee Tools

## Why This Stat Block Format?

Monster stat blocks went through several iterations. The final format prioritises GM usability at the table while preserving flavour for prep.

**The structure:**

```
## Monster Name
**HD X | AC Y | HP Z** | [combat-critical tags]
Atk attacks (damage) | Mv Speed | Ml # | XP ##
Special abilities (what it does).
Flavour text (what it is).
```

**Line 1 - Survival trio first.** HD, AC, HP are bolded and lead. These answer the immediate combat questions: "How tough is this?" Everything else flows from HD anyway (attack bonus, saves, damage scaling).

**Line 1 continued - Combat-critical tags inline.** Darkvision, Blindsight, Regenerate, Immune—things that change how you fight it. These sit right after the survival stats because they matter the moment initiative is rolled.

**Line 2 - What it does to you.** Attacks and damage first (the threat), then logistics (movement, morale, XP). Morale and XP are bookkeeping—important, but not mid-swing.

**Line 3 - Mechanics.** Special abilities, saves, conditions—the unique rules this creature brings. Written as plain English with save type and DC.

**Line 4 - Flavour.** What it looks like, where it lives, how it behaves. GMs can skip this line during combat, but it's there for prep and player questions ("What do I know about trolls?").

**Why separate mechanics from flavour?** Earlier drafts merged them. But at the table, you need different information at different times. During initiative: "It regenerates 3 HP/round." During roleplay: "Rubbery green flesh, long arms, remembers everyone who hurt it." Keeping them on separate lines lets GMs scan efficiently.

**What we cut:**

- **Flavour tags** like [Undead], [Mindless], [Cowardly]. If the description says "walking dead, tireless, hungry"—you don't need a tag saying [Undead]. Morale 12 means fearless; you don't need [Fearless].
- **Redundant immunities.** Undead immunity to poison/charm/sleep is standard. Only note exceptions or unusual immunities.
- **Excessive detail.** A basilisk doesn't need three sentences on petrification mechanics. "Petrifying gaze (CON 12 or stone)" is enough.

**The rhythm.** Each entry has the same beat: name, survival, attacks, mechanics, flavour. Once you've read a few, you know exactly where to look for any piece of information. Consistency aids usability more than any individual formatting choice.

---

# Book Structure

## Why This Reading Order?

The Player's Guide follows a specific sequence: How to Play → Character → Equipment → Magic → Adventuring → Downtime.

**How to Play first.** Every other section uses terms like DC, **Edge**, **Setback**, checks, and saves. By putting the core mechanics at the front, we define these before they appear elsewhere. A reader going cover-to-cover never hits an unexplained term.

OSwR uses different terminology than 5e—Edge instead of advantage, Boost Dice instead of Inspiration, Supply instead of rations, five Fatigue levels instead of exhaustion. These need explaining before character creation starts using them. The goal is simple: no forward references, no flicking back through the book.

**Character includes Classes, Feats, and Advancement.** When players build characters, they're already thinking ahead: "At level 3 I'll take this feat, at level 5 I'll multiclass..." Grouping the full character arc together—creation through progression—matches how players actually think about their builds.

**Magic is separate from Character.** Not everyone plays a caster. Keeping magic in its own section means non-casters can skip it entirely, while casters have everything they need in one place.

**Adventuring and Downtime split the gameplay loop.** Adventuring covers what happens in dangerous places (time, rests, combat, exploration). Downtime covers what happens between adventures (hiring help, carousing). This mirrors how sessions actually flow: venture out, return to town, repeat.

**Equipment before Magic.** You gear up before you study spells. Practical before specialist.

---

# Divergences from OSE/Classic

Beyond the philosophical changes, here are specific mechanical divergences from Old-School Essentials and B/X:

**Saves:** OSE has 5 save categories (Death, Wands, Paralysis, Breath, Spells). OSwR uses 6 ability-based saves with proficiency, matching 5e's structure.

**Thief Skills:** OSE Thieves have percentage-based skills (Pick Locks 15%, Hide in Shadows 10%). OSwR Experts use feats - you either have the ability or you don't, with **Edge** when applicable.

**Turn Undead:** OSE uses a 2d6 table cross-referenced by Cleric level and undead HD. OSwR uses a flat DC 12 check with HD thresholds for effect.

**AC System:** OSE uses descending AC (lower is better) or ascending as an option. OSwR uses ascending AC exclusively, matching 5e.

**Spell Slots vs Memorization:** OSE Magic-Users prepare specific spells into slots (two Sleep means casting Sleep twice). OSwR uses 5e-style slots - prepare a list, spend slots flexibly.

**Hit Dice for HP:** OSE rolls HD at each level (d8 for Fighter). OSwR does the same but offers the option to take the average, reducing variance.

**Multiclassing:** OSE doesn't have multiclassing (demihumans were the multi-role option). OSwR allows multiclassing at odd levels, closer to AD&D's approach.

---

## Feedback Welcome

This is an alpha. Things will change. If something doesn't work at your table, I want to know.

The goal is a game that delivers on its promise: the mechanical familiarity of 5e with the emergent, player-driven adventure of old-school play.

— Damien

# Dungeon Exploration

Dungeons are tracked in **Turns** (10 minutes). Each Turn, the Referee notes light use, movement, and any chance of danger.

> **Turn Procedure**
> 1. Party declares marching order and actions
> 2. Referee describes what they see or encounter
> 3. Roll the hazard die
> 4. Resolve actions (Referee decides when hazard occurs)
> 5. Mark time; track light sources

---

## Movement

In a Turn (10 minutes), a character can move **3× their base speed** in yards while exploring cautiously — checking footing, watching for danger, mapping.

| Speed | Per Round | Per Turn (cautious) | Per Turn (rushing) |
|-------|----------:|--------------------:|-------------------:|
| **Slow** | 15 ft | 45 yards | 90 yards |
| **Normal** | 30 ft | 90 yards | 180 yards |
| **Fast** | 45 ft | 135 yards | 270 yards |

**Rushing:** Double movement, but no searching or mapping. **Setback** on checks to spot traps or hidden features.

---

## Light

Light is precious underground. Track it.

| Source | Duration | Radius |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Torch** | 6 Turns (1 hour) | 30 ft bright, 30 ft dim |
| **Lantern** | 6 hours (1 flask of oil) | 30 ft bright, 30 ft dim |
| **Candle** | 1 hour | 5 ft bright, 5 ft dim |

**Darkvision:** See 30 ft in dim light as if bright, darkness as dim. No color, no fine detail.

**No light:** Effectively blind. **Setback** on all rolls. Movement halved. Can't read, search, or spot danger.

---

## The Hazard Die

Roll **1d6 each Turn**:

| Roll | Result |
|-----:|--------|
| 1 | **Encounter** — a wandering monster appears. |
| 2 | **Sign** — noise, smell, tracks, or shadow hinting at nearby danger. |
| 3 | **Light** — a torch sputters out, or lantern oil runs low. |
| 4 | **Fatigue** — rest now for 10 minutes, or make a CON save (DC 12). Fail the save and gain 1 Fatigue. |
| 5–6 | **Nothing** — the turn passes uneventfully. |

**Use common sense.** If a torch just got lit, a result of 3 might mean it flickers ominously rather than dying. The hazard die creates pressure; it's not a straitjacket.

*Prefer traditional bookkeeping?* Roll a dice of your choice every Turn; on a 1, encounter. Track light (torch = 6 Turns, lantern = 1 Watch) and rest (once per hour) separately.

---

## Searching

Searching a room, passage, or feature for traps, hidden compartments, or secret doors takes **1 Turn**.

**WIS check** — DC set by how well-hidden the feature is. Easy (DC 8) for a loose flagstone; Hard (DC 16) for a master-crafted hidden door.

- **Success:** The Referee reveals what's there.
- **Fail:** Nothing found — but that doesn't mean nothing exists.

**Targeted searching** (examining a specific statue, chest, or section of wall) may take less time at the Referee's discretion.

---

## Surprise

When either side might be caught off guard:

**WIS check (DC 12)** for each character to avoid surprise.

- **Surprised:** Cannot act in the first round of combat.
- **Partial surprise:** Some party members may be surprised while others aren't.

Circumstances grant **Edge** or **Setback** — a party creeping through darkness might surprise a distracted foe; a party arguing loudly won't surprise anyone.

---

## Fatigue & Rest

After **6 Turns** (~1 hour) of exploration, the party should rest for 1 Turn.

Skipping rest → each character makes a **CON save (DC 12)** or gains 1 Fatigue.

Rest means sitting, eating, drinking, catching breath — not moving or doing anything strenuous.

---

## Quick Reference

| Activity | Time | Check |
|----------|------|-------|
| Move (cautious) | 1 Turn | — |
| Move (rushing) | 1 Turn | **Setback** to spot danger |
| Search a room | 1 Turn | WIS vs concealment |
| Force a door | 1 Turn | STR vs door |
| Pick a lock | 1 Turn | DEX vs lock |
| Listen at door | 1 Turn | WIS (Normal) |
| Rest | 1 Turn | — |

**Hazard Die:** Roll 1d6 each Turn.

**Light:** Torch = 6 Turns. Lantern = 6 hours.

# Wilderness Exploration

The wilderness is tracked in **Watches** (4 hours). Six watches make a day.

> **Watch Procedure**
> 1. Party declares activity (travel, hunt, forage, investigate, rest)
> 2. Navigator rolls if traveling through difficult terrain
> 3. Roll hazard die when entering a new or unexplored hex
> 4. Resolve the activity (Referee decides when hazard occurs)
> 5. Mark time; check Supply at end of day

---

## The Day

| Watch | Time | Typical Use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Dawn** | 6am–10am | Break camp, travel |
| **Midday** | 10am–2pm | Travel, activities |
| **Afternoon** | 2pm–6pm | Travel, activities |
| **Evening** | 6pm–10pm | Make camp, eat |
| **Night 1** | 10pm–2am | Rest, keep lookout |
| **Night 2** | 2am–6am | Rest, keep lookout |

**Travel:** A party can travel for **three watches** per day without difficulty. A fourth watch of travel is a forced march — make a CON save, Normal (DC 12) each hour or gain 1 Fatigue.

**Rest:** Characters need **two watches of rest** per day. Someone must keep lookout, but characters can rotate. Missing a night's rest means no rest benefits and requires a CON save, Normal (DC 12) or gain 1 Fatigue. The DC increases by 3 for each consecutive day without proper rest.

**Supply:** Each character consumes **1 Supply per day**. If water is hard to find (desert, arctic), consume **2 Supply per day** to account for carried water.

---

## Terrain

Terrain determines travel speed and activity difficulty.

| Terrain | Speed | Navigation | Hunt | Forage |
|---------|:-----:|:----------:|:----:|:------:|
| **Road, clear trail** | Fast | — | — | — |
| **Coast** | Normal | Easy | Normal | Easy |
| **Grassland, plains** | Normal | Normal | Easy | Easy |
| **Hills** | Normal | Normal | Normal | Normal |
| **Forest** | Slow | Hard | Easy | Easy |
| **Mountains** | Slow | Normal | Hard | Hard |
| **Swamp** | Slow | Hard | Normal | Normal |
| **Desert** | Slow | Normal | Hard | Hard |
| **Arctic** | Slow | Normal | Hard | Hard |

*Easy = DC 8, Normal = DC 12, Hard = DC 16. "—" means no roll needed or not applicable.*

*These are guidelines. Season and conditions can shift difficulty — a forest in winter might be Hard to forage instead of Easy. Use your judgment.*

**Travel speeds:**
- **Fast:** 9 miles per watch (1.5 hexes)
- **Normal:** 6 miles per watch (1 hex)
- **Slow:** 3 miles per watch (half hex)

**Hex scale:** At Normal speed, a party crosses one 6-mile hex per watch, three hexes per day.

**Mounts:** Mounts help on open terrain — roads, plains, grassland. They move one speed category faster in suitable terrain. In swamp, dense forest, or mountains, mounts provide no benefit and may be a liability. Mounts require 1 Supply per day.

---

## Navigation

When traveling through difficult terrain, the navigator makes a **WIS check** each watch. DC set by terrain table.

- **Road or clear landmarks:** No roll needed.

**Getting Lost:** On a failure, the party veers off course. The Referee rolls 1d6 secretly:
- **1–2:** Drift left
- **3–4:** Drift right
- **5–6:** Backtrack (no progress)

They won't realize they're lost until landmarks don't match expectations or a later successful check reveals the error.

---

## Activities

### Travel

Each watch of travel, the party covers distance based on terrain speed. Mark hexes crossed.

### Hunt (2 watches)

Hunting takes **two watches** and cannot be done while traveling.

1. **Locate Prey:** WIS check vs terrain DC.
   - Prey size: **1d6 Supply, +1d6 for every 3 points you beat the DC.**
2. **Kill:** Attack roll vs Normal (DC 12).
   - Success = harvest the Supply.
   - Fail = prey escapes. Can try again next watch.

### Forage (1 watch)

Spend a watch foraging. **WIS check** vs terrain DC.

- **Success:** Find 1d4 Supply.
- **Beat DC by 3+:** Find an additional 1d4 Supply.
- **Fail:** Nothing found.

### Investigate (1 watch)

Spend a watch thoroughly exploring the current hex. The Referee reveals any hidden features — ruins, lairs, resources, hazards, or points of interest that wouldn't be noticed while traveling.

*Some hexes have nothing to find. Others reward careful exploration.*

### Make Camp

At the end of a travel day, one character can search for a good campsite.

**WIS check, Normal (DC 12):**
- **Success:** Defensible site found. **Edge** on lookout checks during the night.
- **Fail:** Exposed site. Normal lookout checks.

### Rest

Characters need **two watches of rest** per day. Someone must keep lookout during the night watches — characters can rotate.

**Interrupted rest** (encounter, severe weather) may require a CON save, Normal (DC 12) or gain 1 Fatigue.

---

## The Hazard Die

The Referee rolls **1d6** when the situation warrants — generally when entering unexplored hexes, and once during the night watches. Roll more often in dangerous territory, less on safe roads. Use your judgment.

| Roll | Result |
|-----:|--------|
| 1 | **Encounter** — roll or choose from your encounter table. |
| 2 | **Sign** — tracks, spoor, distant smoke, sounds. Hints at what's nearby. |
| 3 | **Weather** — conditions shift. Roll on weather table or choose. |
| 4 | **Fatigue** — the journey wears. Consume 1 Supply, or make a CON save, Normal (DC 12) — fail and gain 1 Fatigue. |
| 5–6 | **Clear** — the watch passes uneventfully. |

---

## Weather

When you need weather, roll 2d6:

| 2d6 | Weather |
|----:|---------|
| 2 | **Severe** — storm, blizzard, extreme heat. Travel halted or dangerous. |
| 3–4 | **Poor** — heavy rain, strong winds, bitter cold. Travel one speed slower. |
| 5–9 | **Fair** — typical for the season. No effect. |
| 10–11 | **Good** — clear skies, mild temperature. Pleasant travel. |
| 12 | **Perfect** — ideal conditions. **Edge** on navigation. |

**Poor weather** slows travel by one speed category (Fast becomes Normal, Normal becomes Slow, Slow becomes half speed).

**Severe weather** may halt travel entirely or require CON saves, Normal (DC 12) to avoid Fatigue. Proper gear or shelter grants **Edge**.

---

## Quick Reference

| Activity | Time | Check |
|----------|------|-------|
| Travel | 1 watch | — |
| Navigate | Per watch (difficult terrain) | WIS vs terrain |
| Hunt | 2 watches | WIS + attack vs terrain |
| Forage | 1 watch | WIS vs terrain |
| Investigate | 1 watch | — (automatic) |
| Make camp | End of day | WIS, Normal (DC 12) |
| Rest | 2 watches | — |

**Daily limits:** Travel 3 watches. Rest 2 watches. Forced march = CON save each hour.

**Supply:** 1 per day (2 if water scarce).

**Hex scale:** Normal terrain = 6 miles/watch = 1 hex. Three hexes per day.

**Hazard die:** Generally roll when entering unexplored hexes + once at night.

# Doors & Barriers

Barriers create tension: time lost, noise made, resources burned. Every attempt costs **1 Turn**.

---

## Stuck Doors

Stuck doors are the dungeon fighting back. They exist to cost time, make noise, and force decisions.

A stuck door requires a **STR check (DC 12)** to force open.

- **Fail:** The door holds. Time is lost. They can try again.
- **Success:** The door crashes open — roll the hazard die immediately.

**Tools help.** A crowbar or pry bar grants **Edge**. Multiple characters pushing together can grant **Edge** at your discretion.

Forcing a door is never quiet. Even a failed attempt makes noise.

---

## Locked Doors

Picking a lock requires **Thieves' Tools** and a **DEX check (DC 12)**.

- **Fail:** The lock is jammed. These tools won't open it — they need another way in or must break it down.
- **Success:** The lock clicks open quietly.

**Pick Locks feat:** Characters with this Expert feat open non-magical locks automatically — no check required.

**No tools?** They'll have to break down the door instead (see Stuck Doors).

**Clever solutions:** If players describe removing hinges, pouring acid on the lock, or prying the frame — adjudicate whether it would work. Most doors have hinges on the inside, but not all.

---

## Secret Doors

**Targeted search:** If players search the right area ("I check the bookcase for hidden latches"), they find the door. No roll needed — reward the clever play.

**Room search:** If they search the whole room without a specific spot, call for a **WIS check (DC 12-16)** based on how well-hidden it is. This takes 1 Turn.

**Finding a secret door doesn't mean knowing how to open it.** The mechanism itself is the puzzle: hidden levers, pressure plates, rotating panels, counterweights. Solving it may take multiple Turns of experimentation.

**Elves and Dwarves:** Their ancestry traits (Secret Door Sense, Stone Sense) let you roll a secret check when they pass within 5 ft of hidden features. This is a bonus clue, not a substitute for player engagement.

---

## Noise

Smashing, prying, or forcing anything makes noise. When this happens:

- **Creatures nearby** hear it and react — enemies in the next room come to investigate
- **No one close?** Roll the hazard die to see if something further away takes notice

Clever players may mitigate risk — oiling hinges, padding strikes, prying slowly. Reward this with quieter outcomes, but don't let caution eliminate all tension.

---

## The Pressure

Every barrier costs something:

- **Time** — Turns spent mean torches burning, the hazard die rolling
- **Noise** — Forcing things alerts the dungeon
- **Resources** — Failed attempts still consume the Turn

This is the loop: barriers slow progress, slowing progress burns resources, burning resources raises stakes.

parent: Refereeing
grand_parent: Second Edition
nav_order: 6
---

# Traps & Hazards

Traps reward careful play and punish haste. They're not gotchas — they're puzzles with consequences.

---

## The Core Principle

**Player skill over character skill.** When players describe how they test for or disarm a trap, adjudicate based on logic. If their method would work, it works — no roll needed. Dice are for uncertainty, not for bypassing clever thinking.

---

## Telegraph Danger

Good traps have clues. The more dangerous the trap, the more obvious the warning signs should be:

- Scorch marks on the walls near a fire trap
- A skeleton slumped against a door
- Dust patterns that show where others have stepped (or haven't)
- The faint smell of oil, or the glint of wire

If they're paying attention and asking questions, give them information. If they're rushing, let them find out the hard way.

---

## Finding Traps

**Targeted testing:** If players describe a sensible precaution — prodding with a pole, tossing pebbles, checking for tripwires — and it would reveal the trap, it does. Reward the clever play.

**Room search:** If they search without a specific method ("I search for traps"), call for a **WIS check**. DC depends on how well-hidden: Easy (DC 8) for a crude pit, Hard (DC 16) for a master-crafted pressure plate. This takes 1 Turn.

**Trap Expert feat:** Characters with this Expert feat roll with **Edge** to find, disable, or set traps.

---

## Triggering Traps

Undetected traps trigger when someone walks into them. Decide the effect based on the trap:

- **Direct damage:** Arrow trap (1d6), pit trap (2d6 fall), blade (1d8)
- **Save or effect:** Poison needle (CON save or poisoned), sleep gas (CON save or unconscious), net (DEX save or restrained)

Triggered traps make noise. Nearby creatures hear it; if no one's close, roll the hazard die.

---

## Disarming Traps

When players describe *how* they're disarming — cutting the tripwire, jamming the mechanism, wedging the pressure plate — adjudicate whether it would work. Good plans succeed without a roll.

**Uncertain methods:** Call for a **DEX check (DC 12)**. Failure means the trap triggers. Use common sense about who's affected — a failed disarm of a pit trap might drop the character in; a failed disarm of a dart trap fires into the corridor.

**Tools help.** Thieves' tools, spikes, wire — improvising without proper tools means **Setback**.

**Magical traps** may require *Dispel Magic* or special knowledge to disarm.

---

## Environmental Hazards

Not all dangers are mechanical:

- **Collapsing floors/ceilings** — DEX check to leap clear, or STR check to brace
- **Flooding / Poison gas** — CON check or gain Fatigue (or worse)
- **Mold, slime, fungus** — contact causes disease, poison, or ongoing harm
- **Chasms, lava, unstable bridges** — no save; describe consequences, let players decide risk

---

## Time & Pressure

Every trap interaction costs time:

- **Searching:** 1 Turn
- **Disarming:** 1 Turn
- **Triggering:** Immediate — plus noise alerts the dungeon

The Turn spent means the hazard die rolls, torches burn, and Supply ticks down. This is the pressure that makes traps matter.

title: Reaction Rolls
layout: default
parent: Refereeing
grand_parent: Second Edition
nav_order: 7
---

# Reaction Rolls

Not everything wants to fight. Reaction rolls let the world surprise you — and your players.

---

## Why This Matters

Don't pre-script NPC behaviour. A goblin patrol might be lost, hungry, or fleeing something worse. Bandits might want to negotiate. Even a troll might pause if offered food.

The reaction roll creates emergent encounters. You discover what happens alongside your players, and that's part of the fun.

---

## When to Roll

Roll when the party encounters creatures whose intentions aren't already established. Don't roll for mindless creatures, sworn enemies, or when the party attacks first.

---

## The Roll

Roll **2d6**:

| Roll | Reaction |
|-----:|----------|
| 2 | Hostile — attacks immediately |
| 3–5 | Unfriendly — threatens or demands |
| 6–8 | Uncertain — wary, waiting |
| 9–11 | Friendly — willing to talk |
| 12 | Helpful — offers aid |

Adjust for context: weapons drawn, reputation, gifts offered, what the creatures are protecting. A +1 or −1 either way is usually enough.

---

## After the Roll

The result is a starting point. Good roleplay can shift it — if what the party says or offers makes sense, move the reaction one step without a roll. If it's a hard sell, call for a CHA check.

---

## Retainers

Hiring retainers uses a similar 2d6 reaction roll. See [Retainers](#retainers) for details.




<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

title: Retainers
layout: default
parent: Refereeing
grand_parent: Second Edition
nav_order: 8
---

# Retainers — Loyalty & Morale

Retainers make dangerous dungeons survivable. They carry torches, haul loot, watch the rear, and sometimes fight alongside the party. When a character dies, a loyal retainer can step forward as a replacement — they already know the group, the mission, and the dangers.

---

**Who they are:** Anyone — commoners, mercenaries, adventurers. Lower-level retainers expect a half share of treasure; equal-level demand a full share. Higher-level NPCs won't follow.

**Max Retainers:** A character can lead PB + CHA retainers (minimum 0).

**Retainer Modifier:** Compress CHA for all retainer rolls:

| CHA | Modifier |
|-----|:--------:|
| Negative | −1 |
| 0 | 0 |
| +1 to +2 | +1 |
| +3 or more | +2 |

**Pay:** 2–5 gp/day, plus their share of treasure.

---

## Hiring

**Find candidates:** Taverns, guilds, notice boards — 1d3 available (double in large towns).

**The roll:** 2d6 + Retainer modifier. Adjust for context: generous pay, full shares, good reputation grant +1; stingy terms or a reckless reputation give −1.

| Roll | Result |
|-----:|--------|
| 2–5 | Refuse — and the party's reputation here suffers |
| 6–8 | Hesitant — they can sweeten the deal once and reroll |
| 9–11 | Accept |
| 12+ | Accept eagerly — starts with Loyalty +1 |

---

## Loyalty

Each retainer has a **Loyalty** score (starts at 0, range −3 to +3).

**When to check:** After each adventure, or when ordered into exceptional danger.

**The roll:** 2d6 + Loyalty + Retainer modifier.
- **8+** — they stay on
- **12+** — impressed; Loyalty increases by 1
- **Fail** — they quit, desert, or demand a bonus

**What shifts Loyalty:**
- Gave them gear they keep: +1
- Bonus treasure or extra pay: +1
- Saved their life: +1
- Needlessly risked or abused them: −1

Fair shares are baseline. Shorted or late pay means they leave immediately.

---

## Morale

Retainers check morale when the fight turns grim — same triggers as monsters (first ally down, half the group down, leader killed, overwhelming odds).

**Retainer Morale:** 7 + Loyalty + Retainer modifier

Roll **2d6** against their Morale:
- **Over** — they break (flee, surrender, or withdraw)
- **Equal or under** — they hold

A well-treated retainer with Loyalty +2 and a +2 Retainer modifier has Morale 11 — nearly fearless. A mistreated one might have Morale 4 and run at the first sign of trouble.

---

## Optional Knobs

- **Death payout:** Paying wergild (≈50 gp/level) to a dead retainer's kin avoids −1 to local hiring.
- **Reputation clock:** Each retainer death ticks a 6-segment clock; when full, hiring gets harder until the party mends their name.
- **Generous terms:** Consistently overpaying may grant **Edge** on Loyalty rolls.
- **XP growth:** Retainers gain XP if they survive. Over time, they may level up — or step in as a replacement character.

# Monster Rules

How to read stat blocks and run creatures at your table.

---

## Stat Block Format

```
## Monster Name
**HD X | AC Y | HP Z** | [combat-critical tags]<br>
Atk attacks (damage) | Mv Speed | Ml # | XP ##<br>
Special abilities (DC # STAT or effect).<br>
Flavour text—what it looks like, where it lives, how it behaves.
```

**Line 1:** Name as heading (linkable anchor)
**Line 2:** The survival trio—HD, AC, HP—bolded. Combat-critical tags (Darkvision, Immune, Regenerate, Incorporeal) follow.
**Line 3:** What it does to you (attacks), then secondary info (movement, morale, XP).
**Line 4:** Special abilities—the mechanics you need mid-combat.
**Line 5:** Flavour—what it is. Skip this line during combat, but it's there for prep and player questions.

---

## Derived Stats

Everything flows from **Hit Dice (HD)**:

| Stat | Derivation |
|------|------------|
| **Attack Bonus** | = HD |
| **HP** | = HD × 4 (or roll d8s per HD) |
| **Save Bonus** | = HD ÷ 2 (round up), or HD if excellent, 0 if terrible |
| **XP** | = HD² × 10 (shown in stat block) |
| **Save DC** | HD 1-4: Easy (DC 8) / HD 5-8: Normal (DC 12) / HD 9-12: Hard (DC 16) / HD 13+: Extreme (DC 20) |

---

## Movement

- **Slow** - 15'
- **Normal** - 30'
- **Fast** - 45'

Additional modes noted after: Fly, Swim, Climb, Burrow

---

## Morale (Ml)

Not everything fights to the death. When the situation turns grim, creatures may flee, surrender, or break.

### When to Check

Roll morale when:

- **First blood:** The first ally falls
- **Half down:** Half the group is out of the fight
- **Leader killed:** The boss, champion, or commander drops
- **Overwhelming odds:** Reinforcements arrive, or the situation shifts dramatically against them

The Referee may also call for a check when something terrifying happens (dragon breathes fire, magic backfires spectacularly, etc.).

### The Roll

Roll **2d6** and compare to the creature's **Morale score (Ml)**.

| Result | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| **Over Ml** | They break — flee, surrender, or scatter |
| **Equal or under** | They hold — fight continues |

Creatures with **Ml 12** never check morale — they fight until destroyed (golems, demons, the utterly devoted).

### Morale Scores

| Ml | Typical Creatures |
|---:|-------------------|
| 2 | Cowards, non-combatants forced to fight |
| 5 | Poorly motivated, mercenaries with no stake |
| 7 | Average — goblins, bandits, hired guards |
| 9 | Disciplined — trained soldiers, pack predators |
| 10 | Fanatics, apex predators, undead |
| 12 | Fearless — never flee (golems, demons, the utterly devoted) |

### What Happens When They Break?

The Referee decides based on the creature and situation:

- **Flee** — run for the nearest exit, drop heavy items
- **Surrender** — throw down weapons, beg for mercy
- **Scatter** — each creature runs in a different direction
- **Fighting retreat** — back away while defending, looking for escape

Intelligent creatures may negotiate. Mindless creatures may simply stop fighting and wander. Animals bolt.

### Pursuing Fleeing Enemies

If the party pursues:

- **Faster than the enemy:** Catch them automatically
- **Same speed:** Contest — DEX check vs DEX, or the Referee rules based on terrain
- **Slower:** They escape unless the party has ranged attacks or other advantages

Fleeing creatures may lead pursuers into traps, ambushes, or their lair.

---

## Tags

Tags appear on the stat line only when they affect combat decisions. Flavour tags (Mindless, Cowardly, Undead) are implied by the description or handled in special abilities.

### Combat-Critical Tags

| Tag | Rule |
|-----|------|
| **Darkvision** | Sees in darkness |
| **Blindsight** | Senses without sight (vibration, echolocation) |
| **Tremorsense** | Detects movement through ground |
| **Incorporeal** | Only harmed by silver or magic |
| **Regenerate X** | Recovers X HP per round |
| **Immune: X** | Takes no damage from X |
| **Resist: X** | Half damage from X |
| **Shapechanger** | Can alter form |

### Tags Implied by Description

These don't need a tag line—the description handles them:

- **Undead** — Immune to poison, charm, sleep, fear (mentioned in abilities if relevant)
- **Mindless** — Can't be reasoned with (obvious from behaviour)
- **Cowardly/Fearless** — Reflected in Morale score
- **Swarm** — Half damage from single-target attacks (noted in abilities)

---

## Converting OSR/TSR Monsters

On-the-fly conversion:

1. **HD** - Use as-is (round fractional HD)
2. **AC** - Use ascending AC if given, or convert (descending AC 9 = ascending AC 10)
3. **HP** - HD × 4, or roll d8s
4. **Attacks** - Use damage dice as listed
5. **Morale** - Use as-is (2d6 scale)
6. **Special abilities** - Note in plain English with save type and DC from HD

That's it. No other conversion needed.

# Treasure

Treasure drives the game. Every gold piece recovered from a dangerous location grants 1 XP—making wealth the primary measure of success.

---

## Why Treasure-for-XP?

This system rewards clever play over combat. Sneaking past the dragon to grab its hoard is smarter than fighting it—the gold is worth far more XP than the kill.

When players know that treasure equals advancement, they:
- Scout before fighting
- Negotiate when possible
- Take risks for the big score
- Retreat to fight another day

Combat becomes a tool, not a goal. That's intentional.

---

## XP Values

| Source | XP Value |
|--------|----------|
| Coins, gems, jewelry | 1 XP per 1 GP value |
| Art objects | Appraised value = XP |
| Trade goods | Market value = XP |
| Magic items | No XP (the item is the reward) |
| Monsters defeated | HD² × 10 |

**Recovered, not found.** Treasure only grants XP when brought back to civilization. A hoard discovered but left behind is worth nothing until claimed.

**Magic items grant no XP** because their utility is the reward. This prevents "magic item farming" and keeps the focus on portable wealth.

**Monster XP is secondary.** A dragon's hoard might be worth 10,000 XP. The dragon itself? 810 XP (9 HD² × 10). The math speaks for itself.

---

## Treasure by Dungeon Level

| Roll | Gold | Items |

| 2–3 | 15d10 gp (avg 150) | 1 Minor |

| 20+ | 1,500d10 gp (avg 15,000) | 3 Epic + 3 Major + 2 Minor |

**Note:** A level 1 dungeon rolls d6+1 (range 2–7). A level 5 dungeon rolls d6+5 (range 6–11). Deep dungeons yield greater rewards.

---

## Treasure Tiers

---

## What Kind of Item?

When you need to determine what type of item is found:

| d6 | Item Type |
|---:|-----------|
| 1 | Potion |
| 2 | Scroll |
| 3 | Weapon |
| 4 | Armor or Shield |
| 5 | Wondrous Item |
| 6 | Wondrous Item |

For weapons and armor, use the [Generators](../generators) to determine appearance. For wondrous items, roll on the generator tables to create something unique.

---

## Potions (d6)

| d6 | Minor | Major | Epic |
|---:|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | Healing (1d6+1) | Greater Healing (2d6+2) | Supreme Healing (4d6+4) |
| 2 | Climbing | Invisibility | Invulnerability |
| 3 | Water Breathing | Gaseous Form | Etherealness |
| 4 | Darkvision | Haste | Giant Strength |
| 5 | Resistance (1 type) | Heroism | Longevity |
| 6 | Antidote | Fire Resistance | Flying |

**Weird potions:** Use the [Generators](../generators) with Effect + Form for strange potions. "Whispering + Vial" might be a potion that lets you hear distant conversations.

---

## Scrolls (d6)

Roll spell tier based on treasure tier:
- **Minor:** Tier 1–2 spells
- **Major:** Tier 3–4 spells
- **Epic:** Tier 5–6 spells

| d6 | Scroll Contains |
|---:|-----------------|
| 1–2 | Arcane spell (Magic-User list) |
| 3–4 | Divine spell (Cleric list) |
| 5 | Druid spell |
| 6 | Protection scroll (vs specific creature type) |

---

## Mundane Treasure

Not all treasure is magical. Use [Generators](../generators) to make mundane treasure interesting.

| d6 | Type | Minor Value | Major Value | Epic Value |
|---:|------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | Gemstones | 20–200 gp | 200–1,000 gp | 2,000+ gp |
| 2 | Coins | Ancient, unusual | Trade bars | Royal mint |
| 3 | Map | Fragment | Complete | Legendary location |
| 4 | Art object | Decorative | Masterwork | Priceless |
| 5 | Trade goods | Spices, dyes | Rare materials | Unique components |
| 6 | Documents | Letters, deeds | Contracts, secrets | State secrets |

**Make it specific:** Roll on the generator tables even for mundane treasure. "Gemstones worth 200gp" becomes "six polished amber stones, each carved with a weeping face." Specificity creates questions. Questions create adventures.

---

## Placing Treasure

Not every room has treasure. When stocking a dungeon:

- **Monster lairs:** Usually have treasure (they collected it)
- **Empty rooms:** 1-in-6 chance of hidden treasure
- **Trapped areas:** Often guard something valuable
- **Boss chambers:** The biggest hoard

---

## Quick Reference

1. Roll d6 + dungeon level for hoard size
2. Roll d6 to determine each item type
3. Use [Generators](../generators) to describe items
4. Name Epic items and give them history

# Generators

These d66 tables combine to create items, NPCs, and more. Roll on multiple tables and combine the results - the same combination means different things depending on context.

**The philosophy:** "A sword" and "a guard" are forgettable. "A notched iron blade with a wolf etched into the pommel" and "a nervous guard with flour on his boots" create questions. These tables help you create the second kind.

---

## The d66 System

Roll two six-sided dice. The first die picks the row (1-6), the second picks the column (1-6). A roll of 3,5 means row 3, column 5.

Every table uses this format. Once you learn it, generation takes seconds.

---

## Formula Combinations

Each generator includes **formulas** - explicit instructions for combining tables. This solves the problem many random tables leave implicit: *how do I use these together?*

**Example item formula:** Quality + Material + Form
- Roll Quality: 3,4 = Jeweled
- Roll Material: 1,2 = Iron
- Roll Form: 1,1 = Sword
- Result: Jeweled Iron Sword

**Example NPC formula:** Appearance + Demeanor + Occupation
- Roll Appearance: 1,1 = Scarred
- Roll Demeanor: 2,3 = Gregarious
- Roll Occupation: 4,2 = Soldier
- Result: A scarred, friendly soldier

The formulas range from quick (2-3 tables) to full (5-6 tables). Pick the depth you need.

---

## Context Determines Meaning

The same combination means different things based on where it's found:

**"Ancient Iron Ring"**
- Found in a peasant's pocket: A family heirloom, worth 5gp sentimentally

The tables generate combinations. You interpret them.

## Design Notes

These generators follow principles from Maze Rats and Knave:

1. **d66 tables** - 36 entries each, easy to read, enough variety
2. **Explicit formulas** - Don't make referees figure out combinations
3. **Modular tables** - Roll only what you need
4. **Context over mechanics** - Same result, different meanings
5. **Questions over answers** - Every result should prompt "why?"

The tables grow with use. Add entries that fit your world, remove ones that don't.

# NPCs & Factions

These tables create memorable characters and organizations. Many tables work for both - the same Motivation that drives a bitter innkeeper can drive a guild of assassins.

**The philosophy:** "A thieves' guild" is forgettable. "A network of debt collectors who never forget a slight, led by a woman with a noble's bearing and a debtor's brand on her wrist" creates questions. These tables help you create the second kind.

---

## How to Use These Tables

### Reading d66 Tables

Roll two six-sided dice. The first die picks the row (1-6), the second picks the column (1-6). A roll of 3,5 means row 3, column 5.

### NPC Formulas

| d6 | Formula | Example |
|---:|---------|---------|
| 1 | Detail + Demeanor | Scarred + Nervous |
| 2 | Detail + Voice | One-eyed + Mumbles |
| 3 | Demeanor + Motivation | Cold + Revenge |
| 4 | Detail + Demeanor + Occupation | Branded + Quiet + Merchant |
| 5 | Detail + Demeanor + Voice + Motivation | Hunched + Bitter + Pauses + Knowledge |
| 6 | Full (add Secret + Method) | All of above + Murder + Patience |

### Faction Formulas

| d6 | Formula | Example |
|---:|---------|---------|
| 1 | Type + Motivation | Criminal ring + Wealth |
| 2 | Type + Method | Cult + Manipulation |
| 3 | Type + Motivation + Secret | Noble house + Power + Forbidden knowledge |
| 4 | Type + Motivation + Method | Guild + Control + Alliances |
| 5 | Type + Resources + Reputation | Conspiracy + Information + Feared |
| 6 | Full (add Structure) | All of above + Cells |

### Same Tables, Different Scale

**Motivation: Revenge + Method: Patience**
- **NPC:** A quiet innkeeper who serves the man who ruined him, waiting for the right moment
- **Faction:** A guild that keeps meticulous records of every slight, repaying them years later

**Secret: Forbidden knowledge + Reputation: Respected**
- **NPC:** The village priest everyone trusts, who reads from a book he should have burned
- **Faction:** The scholarly order whose libraries contain things that would see them hanged

## Name Tables

### How Names Work

Each ancestry has **roots** and **endings**. You can:
1. Use a root alone as a short name (Bran, Kaz, Pip)
2. Combine root + ending for a full name (Bran + -wen = Branwen)
3. Combine two roots for a compound name (Bran + Kaz = Brankaz)

Roll once for a quick name. Roll twice and combine for variety.

## Connecting NPCs and Factions

| d6 | Relationship |
|---:|--------------|
| 1 | Leader / founder / face |
| 2 | Loyal member / true believer |
| 3 | Reluctant member / trapped |
| 4 | Secret member / spy |
| 5 | Former member / exile |
| 6 | Enemy / target / rival |

Roll for any NPC: what's their connection to a faction?

---

## Example Generations

**Quick NPC:**

1. **Rolls:** Detail 2,4 = Stained | Demeanor 2,4 = Sly | Voice 4,2 = Avoids eyes
2. **Result:** Someone with stained hands, sly manner, won't meet your gaze
3. **At the table:** "The woman behind the counter has dark stains on her fingers. She smiles too easily and never quite looks at you directly."

**Important NPC:**

1. **Rolls:** Detail 3,4 = Crooked | Demeanor 6,3 = Obsequious | Voice 2,2 = Pauses | Occupation 3,3 = Moneylender | Motivation 1,3 = Revenge | Secret 3,1 = Massacre | Method 5,5 = Waiting
2. **Human name:** Aldric (Ald + -ric)
3. **Result:** Aldric the moneylender - crooked posture, overly servile, pauses mid-sentence, seeking revenge, witnessed (or caused?) a massacre, waiting
4. **Interpretation:** Aldric bows too much and pauses as if listening for something. He was a soldier whose unit was slaughtered - or did the slaughtering. Now he lends money, collects information on everyone who owes him, and waits.

**Faction:**

1. **Rolls:** Type 4,2 = Heretical sect | Motivation 4,4 = Discovery | Secret 4,4 = Dark bargain | Method 4,4 = Infiltration | Resources 3,4 = Ancient texts | Reputation 4,4 = Secretive
2. **Result:** Heretical sect seeking discovery, made a dark bargain, infiltrates other organizations, controls ancient texts, known to be secretive
3. **Interpretation:** The Seekers of the Seventh Truth - a hidden sect that has placed members in churches and libraries across the realm. They search for a specific text prophesied to reveal something. What they traded to learn this, they won't say.

---

## Expanding These Tables

Add entries that fit your world:

- **Ancestry-specific occupations** (Dwarven miners, Elven bowyers)
- **Regional name variations** (Northern humans vs Southern)
- **Campaign-specific factions** (The Empire's spy network, the Merchant Princes)
- **Local secrets** (Everyone in this town knows about the murders)

**Faction names:** Try combining words from Items tables (Colors, Materials, Effects) with group nouns: "The Crimson Circle", "The Iron Brotherhood", "The Whispering Hand". Or use an NPC name: "Aldric's Wolves", "The Children of Thalys".

The system grows with use.

# Item Generator

These tables combine to create items, treasures, and artifacts. Roll on multiple tables and combine the results - the same combination means different things depending on context.

**The philosophy:** "A gold necklace" is forgettable. "A tarnished silver locket containing a portrait of a child" creates questions. These tables help you create the second kind.

---

## How to Use These Tables

### Reading d66 Tables

Roll two six-sided dice. The first die picks the row (1-6), the second picks the column (1-6). A roll of 3,5 means row 3, column 5.

### The Formula System

Pick or roll a formula, then roll on the indicated tables:

| d6 | Formula | Example |
|---:|---------|---------|
| 1 | Material + Form | Bone Ring |
| 2 | Color + Form | Crimson Mask |
| 3 | Quality + Form | Ancient Crown |
| 4 | Quality + Material + Form | Cracked Obsidian Bowl |
| 5 | Color + Material + Form | Verdigris Bronze Mirror |
| 6 | Quality + Color + Material + Form | Ornate Crimson Bone Cup |

For **magical items**, add Effect and optionally Quirk:

| d6 | Magical Formula | Example |
|---:|-----------------|---------|
| 1 | Effect + Form | Whispering Blade |
| 2 | Effect + Material + Form | Burning Salt Chain |
| 3 | Material + Effect + Form | Iron Devouring Mask |
| 4 | Quality + Effect + Form | Ancient Binding Crown |
| 5 | Effect + Form (Quirk) | Screaming Mirror (Jealous) |
| 6 | Full combination (Quirk) | Forgotten Bone Weeping Skull (Hungry) |

### Context Determines Power

The same combination means different things based on where it's found:

**Crimson + Bone + Cup**
- **Mundane treasure:** A drinking cup carved from stained bone. Worth 15gp to the right buyer.
- **Minor magic:** A cup that fills with blood-red wine once per day. The wine is nourishing but tastes of copper.
- **Major magic:** Drink from it while holding bones to speak with their former owner. One question per use.
- **Epic artifact:** "The Skull-Cup of Marath" - any bones placed within reform into a loyal skeleton servant.

## Using Multiple Effect Tables

For complex items, roll on both Effect tables:

**Elemental + Spiritual combinations:**
- Burning + Binding = Chains of fire that hold what they touch
- Freezing + Whispering = Ice that speaks the last words of the frozen
- Bleeding + Watching = A wound that lets you see through the injured

---

## Example Generation

**Rolling a Major magic item:**

1. **Formula:** Effect + Material + Form (Worn) + Quirk
2. **Rolls:** Effect (Spiritual) 3,2 = Sealing | Material 1,4 = Silver | Form (Worn) 2,5 = Medallion | Quirk 3,4 = Possessive
3. **Raw result:** Sealing Silver Medallion (Possessive)
4. **Interpretation:** A silver medallion that can seal a single spell within it. Once used, it refuses to seal anything else until the original spell is released - even if that takes years.

**Rolling mundane treasure:**

1. **Formula:** Quality + Color + Material + Form (Mundane)
2. **Rolls:** Quality 3,4 = Jeweled | Color 1,3 = Rust | Material 6,3 = Horn | Form (Mundane) 1,2 = Chalice
3. **Raw result:** Jeweled rust-colored horn chalice
4. **Interpretation:** A drinking horn set with garnets, the horn itself stained dark red from years of wine. Worth 200gp, but the garnets are worth more removed - if you can find a buyer who won't ask where it came from.

## Expanding These Tables

These tables are starting points. As you play:

- **Add materials** from your world (mithril, dragonbone, ghost-iron)
- **Add forms** players find interesting (specific cultural items)
- **Add effects** that fit your campaign's magic
- **Replace entries** that don't fit your tone

The system grows with use.

# Domain Play

*This section is coming in a future update.*

---

## What Is Domain Play?

At higher levels, adventurers stop being wandering treasure-hunters and start becoming powers in their own right. They build strongholds, hire retinues, and manage domains.

Domain Play provides rules for:

- **Strongholds** — building keeps, towers, temples, and hideouts
- **Retinues** — hiring specialists, soldiers, and servants beyond simple retainers
- **Domain Management** — income, expenses, and the responsibilities of rulership
- **Warfare** — when diplomacy fails and armies march

---

## Why It Matters

Gold is the primary source of XP in OSwR. At low levels, training costs, spell research, carousing, and tithes absorb excess wealth. At higher levels, these sinks aren't enough.

Domain Play is the **gold sink for high-level play**. Building a keep costs thousands. Maintaining troops costs hundreds per month. Running a domain means ongoing expenses that give purpose to continued treasure-hunting.

Without somewhere for gold to go, the economy breaks. Domain Play completes the loop.

---

## For Alpha Playtesters

These rules aren't included in the alpha release. If your campaign reaches the point where characters have more gold than they can spend, consider:

- **Carousing heavily** — spend it on XP directly (with mishap risk)
- **Commissioning expensive items** — magic gear, ships, rare materials
- **Investing in the community** — temples, guilds, infrastructure
- **Banking it** — 10% withdrawal fee means it's not immediately liquid

We're working on full Domain Play rules for a future release. If your group has feedback on what you'd want from this system, let us know on Discord.
