# OSwR Tone Guide

How the book should sound. Update this as we refine the voice.

---

## The Voice

You're explaining rules to a friend at your table. Friendly, direct, no waffle. You respect the reader's time but you're not cold about it.

**Think:** Enthusiastic explainer, not technical manual.

---

## Core Rules

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Second person ("you roll") | Third person ("the player rolls") |
| Contractions ("don't", "you've") | Formal ("do not", "you have") |
| Active voice ("you avoid harm") | Passive ("harm is avoided") |
| Brief context before mechanics | Mechanics only, no setup |
| Light humor where natural | Forced jokes or no personality |
| American spelling (armor, favor) | UK spelling (armour, favour) |

---

## Terminology

**Abilities, not ability scores/modifiers.**

The number on your sheet (-2, +1, +3) is just your "ability" or "your STR". No need for "ability score" or "ability modifier" - those are legacy terms.

- Say: "Roll d20 + STR"
- Not: "Roll d20 + STR modifier"
- Say: "Your DEX is +2"
- Not: "Your DEX modifier is +2"

**IMPORTANT:** This is a book-wide change. Search for "ability score", "ability modifier", "modifier" and update to just "ability" or the specific ability name (STR, DEX, etc.).

**Ancestry, not race/species/people.**

Use "ancestry" for Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Human. Not "race" (loaded term), "species" (too clinical), or "people" (grammatically awkward).

- Say: "Choose your ancestry"
- Not: "Choose your race"
- Say: "Your ancestry's tongue"
- Not: "Your racial tongue"

**IMPORTANT:** Book-wide change. Search for "race", "racial", "species", "people" (in this context) and update.

**Difficulty class labels with numbers.**

Use natural language labels (Easy, Normal, Hard) but always include the DC in parentheses. This teaches the vocabulary while keeping pages self-contained - no flipping back to find what "Normal" means.

- Say: "Normal (DC 12) WIS check"
- Not: "Normal WIS check"
- Say: "Hard (DC 16) save"
- Not: "Hard save"

**IMPORTANT:** Book-wide pattern. Search for "Easy", "Normal", "Hard" difficulty references and add the DC number.

## Page Structure

Every page follows this pattern:

```
# Heading

[One punchy intro line - friendly, direct, sets context]

---

## First Section
[Content]
```

The intro line comes right after the heading, before any sections. It's one sentence that tells the reader what this page is about or what they'll do here.

Good examples:
- "Here's what you'll do:" (character-creation)
- "When the outcome's uncertain, you roll dice." (rolling-dice)
- "Here's how fights work." (combat)
- "Feats let you customize your character beyond class and background." (feats)

Bad:
- No intro (jumping straight to ## Section)
- Flowery filler ("Your equipment reflects your journey...")

---

## Self-Contained Pages

Each page should make sense without requiring the reader to have memorised earlier content. Include key numbers inline rather than assuming knowledge. Think OSE - everything you need is right there.

---

## Sentence Rhythm

**Lead with context, follow with mechanics.**

Bad:
> - Roll `d20 + ability modifier`.
> - Success: Total ≥ DC.

Good:
> When the outcome's uncertain, roll d20 + your ability modifier. Beat the DC and you succeed.

---

## Warmth Without Waffle

You can be concise AND warm. One human sentence before the crunch:

> **Saving Throws**
> When something nasty happens fast, you make a saving throw.
> Roll d20 + ability mod (+ proficiency if you've got it) vs the DC.

Not:

> **Saving Throws**
> - Used for sudden threats (traps, spells, hazards).
> - Roll `d20 + relevant ability modifier`.

---

## Asides and Personality

Occasional direct comments are fine:

- "That's it."
- "(yes, really)"
- "go play 5e"
- "if you're lucky, retire as a legend"

Don't overdo it. One per page max, if it fits naturally.

---

## Tables and Lists

Tables and bullet lists are fine - this is a reference book. But:

- Introduce them with a sentence
- Use "you" in the content where possible
- Keep entries parallel in structure

**Prefer prose over fragments.** Don't write:
```
- **Carry:** 10 + STR slots.
- **Backpack:** +10 slots.
```

Write:
```
You can carry 10 + STR slots. A backpack adds another 10.
```

Bullet points are for lists of distinct items (weapons, feats, spells). For rules that flow together, use sentences.

---

## What to Avoid

| Pattern | Why it's wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| "One must consider..." | Too formal |
| "It should be noted that..." | Filler |
| "The character may choose to..." | Third person, passive |
| "Utilise" instead of "use" | Pretentious |
| No contractions anywhere | Reads robotic |
| Wall of bullets with no intro | Cold, reference-manual feel |

---

## Reference: The Original Voice

From the 2021 intro:

> "And play it I did! The game you've got in your hands is the result of 100's of hours at the table."

> "This is now your game! Take what you want and adapt what you need to fit your table."

> "So steal what you want, that's what it's here for."

Sign-off: Just "Damien" - no title, no formality.

### Book-Wide Passes (after page-by-page review)
- [ ] DC format: Search "Easy", "Normal", "Hard" and add DC numbers (e.g., "Normal (DC 12)")
- [ ] Terminology: Search "ability score", "ability modifier", "modifier" → just ability name
- [ ] Terminology: Search "race", "racial" → ancestry
