## Banshee
*Created by knighterrant1663*

**HD 6 | AC 16 | HP 24** | Incorporeal | Immune: non-magical weapons<br>
Atk touch (special) | Mv Fly Fast | Ml 10 | XP 360

**STR Drain:** Touch drains 1 point of STR. Victim becomes a banshee if reduced to STR −5.

**Dreadful Wail (1/day):** All living beings within 60 ft must make a DC 12 CON save or drop to 0 HP. Creatures that save are immune to this banshee's wail for 24 hours.

The malevolent restless spirit of a wronged woman who now exists only to torment the living.
