## Dragonborn
*Created by knighterrant1663*

**Size:** Medium · **Languages:** Common, Draconic
**Age:** Adult ~14–17 · Lifespan ~70–110

Select a dragon colour as your bloodline (your abilities are based on your bloodline):

| Bloodline | Element |
|-----------|---------|
| Black / Copper | Acid |
| Blue / Bronze | Lightning |
| Brass / Red / Gold | Fire |
| Green | Poison |
| Silver / White | Cold |

- **Draconic Resistance:** **Edge** on saves vs your bloodline element, and half damage from that element.
- **Draconic Breath:** A number of times per day equal to your PB, you may unleash a breath weapon:
  - 15 ft cone or 30 ft line (chosen at level 1)
  - 2d6 damage of your bloodline element
  - DC 8 + PB + CON, save for half

*Designer Note: Only the two iconic Dragonborn abilities are included—they're already quite powerful, so additional traits would be too much. Draconic language is at Referee discretion; some campaigns may treat it as a secret or dead language.*

**Age:** Adult ~14–16 · Lifespan ~65–85

- **Darkvision (30 ft).**
- **Fearsome Reputation:** **Edge** on checks to intimidate others.
- **Mighty Build:** Treat **Bulky** items as 1 slot.
