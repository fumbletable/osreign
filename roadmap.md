# Roadmap

OSwR Second Edition is currently in **Alpha**.

---

## Current Phase: Alpha

**Goal:** Validate core rules before locking them down.

### What We're Testing

- **Boost Dice economy** - PB starting pool + nat 1 recovery. Does it create real choices?
- **Conditions** - 13 defined conditions. Are they used consistently? Is Shaken distinct from Frightened?
- **Archetype builds** - Can you build Paladin, Ranger, Monk, Bard using feats alone?
- **Creation tools** - Do Build-an-Ancestry, Build-a-Spell, and the stat block format actually work?

### Alpha Exit Criteria

We leave Alpha when:

- [x] Rules gaps closed: crafting (see [Alchemy](second-edition/players/alchemy))
- [ ] Rules gaps closed: mounted combat
- [ ] 7 classic archetypes built and documented
- [ ] Play tested across levels 1-9
- [ ] External creators successfully use the Build-a-X tools
- [ ] Conditions audit complete

---

## Next: Beta

**Goal:** Complete GM tools and high-level play.

- **GM Kit** - Dungeon, wilderness, and town generators
- **Domain Play** - Strongholds, retainers, warfare (levels 10-12)
- **Voice Pass** - Editorial consistency across all content

---

## Then: Release

**Goal:** Print-ready PDF.

- PDF layout and print formatting
- Character sheet and GM reference
- Changelog from First Edition

**The promise:** Free PDF, at-cost print.

## How You Can Help

OSwR is shaped by the people who play it. Every session, every build, every "this bit confused me" makes the game better. Here's how to get involved:

### Play It

Run a session. Even a one-shot helps. Then tell me:

- Did Boost Dice feel right? Too few? Too many?
- Did any rule slow you down or need a house rule?
- Did danger feel real at your level?

A sentence or two in Discord is more valuable than silence. Your table is unique—I want to know what you found.

### Build Something

The whole point is that four classes + feats = any archetype. Prove it or break it:

- **Paladin, Ranger, Monk, Bard, Assassin, Illusionist, Necromancer** - can you build one that feels right?
- **Your own ancestry** using [Build-an-Ancestry](second-edition/players/build-an-ancestry)
- **A spell** using [Build-a-Spell](second-edition/players/build-a-spell)
- **A monster** using the [stat block format](second-edition/refereeing/bestiary/monster-rules)

Share what you make. If the tools work, I want to see what you create. If they don't, I need to know where they broke.

### Spot Problems

Broken link? Confusing wording? Rule that contradicts itself?

[Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/damienfegan/oswr) or drop it in Discord. Even small catches help—typos, formatting issues, "I couldn't find X." You're not being picky, you're making the game better.
