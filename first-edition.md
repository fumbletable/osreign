## What's Different in Second Edition?

The Second Edition builds on the original with refined mechanics:

| Aspect | First Edition | Second Edition |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Advantage/Disadvantage | 5e-style (roll 2d20) | EDGE/SETBACK (+/-1d6) |
| Inspiration | 5e-style | Replaced by Boost Dice |
| Resource pool | None | Boost Dice (session-based) |
| Expert identity | Thief-adjacent | Universal competence |
| Druid | Not included | Cleric Oath (Druidic) |
| General Feats | Limited | Every even level |

The original was designed for VTT 5e compatibility. Second Edition optimises for physical table play with dice you can see and trade.
